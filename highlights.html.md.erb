### <a id='syslog-agent'></a> Syslog Agents Replace Syslog Adapter

Syslog Agents are enabled by default, and the option to disable Syslog Agents is removed. Syslog Agents increase the number of syslog drain service bindings supported by the Loggregator system and reduce the workload for Loggregator VMs, including Syslog Adapters.
