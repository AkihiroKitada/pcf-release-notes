## Issues with Application Uptime in PCF Elastic Runtime v1.7.0 - v1.7.15

Issue:
If you kill the NATS server without stopping it cleanly or if you upgrade/stop/restart NATS in an environment where the IPSec add-on is applied, then you may experience a period of application downtime. More information can be found in this [Knowledge Base](https://discuss.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/226130787-NATS-timeout-issue) article.

### Recommended action

Contact Pivotal Support for remediation of application downtime if you have IPSec versions older than 1.5.37 and an Elastic Runtime older than 1.7.15.

## Issues with Autoscaling in PCF Elastic Runtime v1.7.10 - 1.7.13

Issue:
PCF Elastic Runtime versions 1.7.0 to 1.7.13 contain a version of PCF Autoscale app (a service used to scale your app instances automatically) that periodically crashes once a scaling event has taken place.

This will be fixed soon in a future patch release of Elastic Runtime.

### Recommended action

If you are planning to install these affected versions of Elastic Runtime and you use the autoscaling service, before you deploy the upgrade, disable the following:
The errand that pushes an updated autoscale app (Deploy CF Autoscaling App)
The errand to register the service broker (Register Autoscaling Service Broker)

Disabling these errands will prevent the new malfunctioning autoscale app from being deployed, and will allow you to continue using the old autoscale app as before.

### Please note
If you have already upgraded to PCF Elastic Runtime versions 1.7.10 to 1.7.13 and you did not disable these errands, your updated version of the PCF Autoscale app will intermittently crash until a patch has been released. If you are experiencing this issue, you will need to manually scale your apps until the fix has been released.

If you need further assistance, please contact [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io/).

## New Issues

* Elastic Runtime v1.7.20 has a version of UAA which does not upgrade successfully to any versions of Elastic Runtime that is not at least v1.7.24.

* Autoscaling does not work in PCF Elastic Runtime versions 1.7.10 to 1.7.13.

* The Single Sign-On service tile operates in lockstep with PCF Elastic Runtime. If you are a customer upgrading from PCF 1.6 to PCF 1.7 and you are using SSO v1.0.x, you must upgrade to the SSO v1.1.0 service tile while you are upgrading the Elastic Runtime Tile to 1.7, in the same "Update" step.

* LDAP SSL with self-signed certificates is not functional in the PCF 1.7.2 release. Upgrading to this release will cause UAA to not start up. This issue will be addressed in the next patch release (1.7.3) of PCF.

* The Push Notifications service tile operates in lockstep with PCF Elastic Runtime. If you are a customer upgrading from PCF 1.6 to PCF 1.7 and you are using Push Notifications v1.4.4 or earlier versions, you must upgrade to the Push Notifications v1.4.5 tile when you upgrade the Elastic Runtime Tile to 1.7.

* The Apps Manager console URL has changed from **console**._YourSystemDomain_ to **apps**._YourSystemDomain_ with no redirect. If you experience any issues because of this change, please contact [Support](http://support.pivotal.io).

* Apps Manager's "Tools" page links to the incorrect version of the cf CLI. To get the latest version, download it directly from [the CLI releases page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases).

* When you upgrade Ops Manager from 1.6 to 1.7 on vSphere or vCloud, you might notice that several of your Elastic Runtime VMs will automatically resize to have more CPU, memory, and/or disk. This is because the new Ops Manager defines specific instance types instead of custom sizings, and each instance will adopt an instance type that is the closest match to the previous custom size. For instance, you might see the Diego Cells will increase their CPU to 4 and their disk to 130 GB per Cell if you kept the default size of Cell instances from Elastic Runtime 1.6.x. If you disagree with the instance size automatically selected, you may select a different type anytime.

* No metrics from any jobs in Elastic Runtime 1.7.0 will be emitted to the firehose, so none of these metrics will appear in the JMX bridge. This was fixed in 1.7.1.

* Java apps can take advantage of the custom certificate authority feature of PCF 1.7, but it requires using a more recent Java buildpack version than the one included with Elastic Runtime 1.7.0. The buildpack version is 3.7, and it requires that you also enable the Container Certificate Trust Store feature. The feature is turned off by default, because it can impact staging performance of Java apps, adding an extra 45 seconds or so.

* The cross-container traffic checkbox is removed from Elastic Runtime, because since the migration from the DEA architecture to Diego, this feature setting is now controlled by your CF application security groups.


## Existing Issues

* Do not put an apostrophe in database passwords for Elastic Runtime. The notifications and autoscale system apps are unable to use a password with an apostrophe.

* Diego Cells may sometimes time out on app pushes when any given Diego Cell receives its first app push with no buildpack specified for that app. This is because the Cell is caching all of the buildpacks for subsequent app pushes, and this may take longer than what the app staging allows.

* The CLI command for viewing application files, `cf files`, does not work with applications on Diego.

* To SSH into an application container on Diego, your CF user must have the Space Developer role attached to it for the application space.

* The Smoke Tests may occasionally fail at the logging test suite. The Smoke Tests errand is fine to re-run in case of any failures.

* .NET support on Windows cells does not support the same level of security and isolation as seen on Linux cells. At this time, it is only recommended for running "trusted" apps.

* At this time, the container accounts on Windows cells must have permissions to log on locally, which may not be the default.

* Application file names on Windows cells are limited to maximum length of 100 characters. As a workaround, make sure that all filenames in an application directory are shorter than 100 characters before pushing.

* On the Security Config page of Elastic Runtime, after you supply your own cipher sets and click Save, do not erase the HAProxy and Router Cipher fields. The ciphers will not return to their default values when deleted, and will instead be interpreted as an empty cipher set.

* When selecting between internal and external System Database and/or File Storage config, if saved values for external systems fail verification (e.g. a host is not reachable from Ops Manager), the values will persist if you then select 'Internal Databases' or 'Internal File Store'. To resolve this issue, return to your Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Revert**, located in the upper right corner of the page.
