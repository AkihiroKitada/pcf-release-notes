Operators can install PCF Runtime for Windows on vSphere, Amazon Web Services
(AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure. For more information, see the
[Deploying PCF Runtime for
Windows](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/windows/deploy-windows.html)
topic.

## <a id='upgrade'></a>How to Upgrade

The PCF Runtime for Windows v1.11 tile is available with the release of Pivotal
Cloud Foundry (PCF) version 1.11. To use the PCF Runtime for Windows tile, you
need Ops Manager v1.11.0 or later and Elastic Runtime v1.11.0 or later.

For information about upgrading to PCF Runtime for Windows v1.11.0, see the
[Upgrading Windows
Cells](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/windows/upgrade-windows.html)
topic in the PCF Runtime for Windows documentation.

## <a id='adv-features'></a> About Advanced Features

The Advanced Features section of the PCF Runtime for Windows tile includes new
functionality that may have certain constraints.  Although these features are
fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in production.

## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in PCF Runtime for Windows 1.11

### <a id='sha2'></a>SHA2 Checksum

Operators can verify the data integrity of the PCF Runtime for Windows tile
using the file's SHA2 checksum, rather than the MD5 checksum that was used in
previous releases.

### <a id='iso-seg'></a> Isolation Segment

Operators can deploy their PCF Runtime for Windows application workloads to an
isolation segment by entering a **Segment Name** in the **Application
Containers** section and performing the steps in the [Create an Isolation
Segment](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/adminguide/isolation-segments.html#create-an-is)
section of the <em>Managing Isolation Segments</em> topic to create the
isolation segment in the Cloud Controller Database (CCDB).

### <a id='local-route-emitter'></a> Cell-local Route Emitters

In previous versions of the PCF Runtime for Windows tile, the Diego Cells relied upon
the Route Emitter component on the Diego Brain in the Elastic Runtime Tile to
notify the Router of application routes.  When the Route Emitter becomes
unavailable, routes can be lost in the Router route table. In order to improve
the availability of the Route Emitter and reduce the impact of downtime from
this component, the Route Emitter is now colocated on the Diego Cell for which
it emits application routes.
