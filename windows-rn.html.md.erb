Operators can install PCF Runtime for Windows on vSphere, Amazon Web Services
(AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure. See the
[Deploying PCF Runtime for Windows](../windows/deploy-windows.html) topic for more information.

## <a id='upgrade'></a>How to Upgrade

The PCF Runtime for Windows v1.12 tile is available with the release of Pivotal
Cloud Foundry (PCF) version v1.12. To use the PCF Runtime for Windows tile, you
need Ops Manager v1.12.0 or later and Elastic Runtime v1.12.0 or later.

For information about upgrading to PCF Runtime for Windows v1.12.0, see the
[Upgrading Windows Cells](../windows/upgrade-windows.html) topic in the PCF Runtime for Windows documentation.

## <a id='adv-features'></a> About Advanced Features

The **Advanced Features** pane of the PCF Runtime for Windows tile includes new
functionality that may have certain constraints. Although these features are
fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in production.

## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in PCF Runtime for Windows v1.12

This section describes new features of the release.

### Diego Cell Max-in-Flight Default

The max-in-flight percentage for the Diego Cell job in the Isolation Segment
has been set to 10% since 1.10, but we've seen especially in larger
environments that having the percentage this high can cause some problems:

* Many simultaneous VM creates/deletes and BOSH blob updates can place
significant stress on the underlying infrastructure, especially on vSphere
which has a greater probability of being under-provisioned.
* The cells that are draining are no longer available for allocation, resulting
in a 10% decrease in total memory and disk capacity during the deployment. This
can cause deployments to no longer have sufficient total capacity to run all
the work, or to have insufficient headroom to place larger workloads
successfully.

For these reasons, we have lowered the default max-in-flight percentage on the
Diego Cells to 4%. Operators can still use the Ops Manager API to configure
this setting to fit their needs.

### Improved System Performance for App Health Checks

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature requires that you <a
href="../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#cc">enable secure communication between
the Cloud Controller and Diego</a>.</p>

This release changes how Runtime for Windows runs app health checks to improve
system performance in resource-constrained environments, such as on-premise
installations of PCF. This change does not impact the developer workflow for
[configuring app health checks](../devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html).

Health checks during app startup previously increased system load because they
ran as a Garden-Windows process every two seconds. Also, apps that started
successfully could wrongly fail if slow system performance caused the app
health check to time out. In some severe cases, such app failures caused
additional resource consumption and a chain-reaction of app failures.

This release resolves these issues through a new implementation that does not
invoke a new process on every health check. Rather, the health check now runs
as a long-lived process in the app container.

### VM Administrator Password Configuration

VMs can now be accessed with a configurable VM Administator Password.
Operators will have the choice of using the default password, setting their
own, or having each VM use a randomly generated password.
