## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

The PCF Runtime for Windows tile is a new Pivotal product offering as of version 1.9.0. There are two possible scenarios in which you could be “upgrading,” if you have a deployment of Windows VMs by using the DiegoWindows MSI installer or by using the BOSH Release for Windows BETA.

To upgrade to the Runtime for Windows tile, you need OpsManager 1.9.2 or later and Elastic Runtime 1.9.0 or later. See the [Migrating from Diego Windows](../windows/msi-crossgrade.html) topic in the [Using PCF Runtime for Windows](../windows/index.html) documentation for more information.
