## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in PAS for Windows 2012R2 v2.0

### <a id="RDP"></a> RDP Option Now Available in VM Options

The **VM Options** pane in the **PAS for Windows** tile now optionally supports connection to all VMs via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). 

### <a id="kms"></a> KMS Configuration Option Now Available in VM Options

The **VM Options** pane in the **PAS for Window 2012R2** tile now allows you to enable and configure KMS with a hostname and port. Previously, this had to be performed manually by editing the runtime config. For more information, see [Configuring a KMS Host](../windows2012r2/configure-kms.html).

### <a id='colocated-errands'></a> Colocated Errands on Instance VMs

The PAS tile no longer includes individual errand VMs. Instead, the errand jobs are colocated on other VMs in the deployment. Colocated errands run faster than traditional errands and use fewer resources, including disk and IP space. These errands are now set to always run by default.

## <a id='adv-features'></a> About Advanced Features

The **Advanced Features** pane of the PAS for Windows 2012R2 tile includes new
functionality that may have certain constraints. Although these features are
fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in production.
