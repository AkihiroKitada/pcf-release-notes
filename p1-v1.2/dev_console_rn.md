title: Pivotal Developer Console v1.2.0.0 Release Notes
---

## Changes since v1.1.0.0:

The new Org Dashboard in v1.2 provides a count of all apps and services in each space. Additional API calls are made to get the status--green is running, red is crashing or crashed, and gray is stopped--of each app, and this status is kept up-to-date every 30 seconds. On recent browsers, updating is blocked when Developer Console is not the active tab.
