title: Pivotal Elastic Runtime&reg; v1.7 Known Issues
owner: Release Engineering
---

## New Issues

* The Single Sign-On service tile operates in lockstep with Pivotal Elastic Runtime. If you are a customer upgrading from PCF 1.6 to PCF 1.7 and you are using SSO v1.0.x, you must upgrade to the SSO v1.1.0 service tile when you upgrade the Elastic Runtime Tile to 1.7.

* The Push Notifications service tile operates in lockstep with Pivotal Elastic Runtime. If you are a customer upgrading from PCF 1.6 to PCF 1.7 and you are using Push Notifications v1.4.4 or earlier versions, you must upgrade to the Push Notifications v1.4.5 tile when you upgrade the Elastic Runtime Tile to 1.7.

* The Apps Manager console URL has changed from **console**._YourSystemDomain_ to **apps**._YourSystemDomain_ with no redirect. If you experience any issues because of this change, please contact [Support](http://support.pivotal.io).

* Apps Manager's "Tools" page links to the incorrect version of the cf CLI. To get the latest version, download it directly from [the CLI releases page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases).

* When you upgrade Ops Manager from 1.6 to 1.7 on vSphere or vCloud, you might notice that several of your Elastic Runtime VMs will automatically resize to have more CPU, memory, and/or disk. This is because the new Ops Manager defines specific instance types instead of custom sizings, and each instance will adopt an instance type that is the closest match to the previous custom size. For instance, you might see the Diego Cells will increase their CPU to 4 and their disk to 130 GB per Cell if you kept the default size of Cell instances from Elastic Runtime 1.6.x. If you disagree with the instance size automatically selected, you may select a different type anytime.

* No metrics from any jobs in Elastic Runtime 1.7.0 will be emitted to the firehose, so none of these metrics will appear in the JMX bridge. This was fixed in 1.7.1.

* Java apps can take advantage of the custom certificate authority feature of PCF 1.7, but it requires using a more recent Java buildpack version than the one included with Elastic Runtime 1.7.0. The buildpack version is 3.7, and it requires that you also enable the Container Certificate Trust Store feature. The feature is turned off by default, because it can impact staging performance of Java apps, adding an extra 45 seconds or so.

* The cross-container traffic checkbox is removed from Elastic Runtime, because since the migration from the DEA architecture to Diego, this feature setting is now controlled by your CF application security groups.

## Existing Issues

* Diego Cells may sometimes time-out on app pushes when any given Diego Cell receives its first app push with no buildpack specified for that app. This is because the Cell is caching all of the buildpacks for subsequent app pushes, and this may take longer than what the app staging allows.

* Diego Cells may sometimes experience slow performance for various actions like staging new applications. If you experience slow performance, you can SSH into the Ops Manager VM and `bosh-recreate` the affected Diego Cell VM.

* Docker library images require you to specify "library/" in front of the docker image name. E.g "cf p jetty -o library/jetty"

* Diego Cells may run out of disk space if they using a lot of different Docker images with different layers.

* The CLI command for viewing application files, `cf files`, does not work with applications on Diego.

* The Diego BBS may output a TLS handshake error every three seconds in the sys logs. This error is fine to ignore, and will be fixed in a future release of Diego.

* To SSH into an application container on Diego, your CF user must have the Space Developer role attached to it for the application space.

* The Smoke Tests may occasionally fail at the logging test suite. The Smoke Tests errand is fine to re-run in case of any failures.

* .NET support on Windows cells does not support the same level of security and isolation as seen on Linux cells. At this time, it is only recommended for running "trusted" apps.

* At this time, the container accounts on Windows cells must have permissions to log on locally, which may not be the default.

* Application file names on Windows cells are limited to maximum length of 100 characters. As a workaround, make sure that all filenames in an application directory are shorter than 100 characters before pushing.

* On the Security Config page of Elastic Runtime, after you supply your own cipher sets and click Save, do not erase the HAProxy and Router Cipher fields. The ciphers will not return to their default values when deleted, and will instead be interpreted as an empty cipher set.

* When selecting between internal and external System Database and/or File Storage config, if saved values for external systems fail verification (e.g. a host is not reachable from Ops Manager), the values will persist if you then select 'Internal Databases' or 'Internal File Store'. To resolve this issue, return to your Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Revert**, located in the upper right corner of the page.
