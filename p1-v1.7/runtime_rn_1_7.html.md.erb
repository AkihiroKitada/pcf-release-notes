## 1.7.12

This release adds all link-local addresses, in the range of 169.254.0.0/16, to be excluded from access in the default application security group of Elastic Runtime. This range includes the metadata endpoints of most IaaS providers, such as AWS. This security group does not take effect for upgrades, only new installs of Elastic Runtime. If you would like to update your pre-existing deployment, please refer to the [Application Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) topic of our documentation.

This also introduces a patch to Cloud Controller's API that will enable use of the upcoming Spring Cloud Data Flow’s Task support on Cloud Foundry. More about this release will be announced soon.

This also updates Consul to v96 in preparation for future upgrades to Elastic Runtime 1.8 (the release of which is upcoming), which will require all components to adopt a new format for the bosh manifest.

## 1.7.11

Note: The Cloudformation script for PCF setup on AWS was updated at the same time as this release to switch over to using a NAT EC2 instance instead of a NAT gateway, as there is a known issue with AWS NAT gateways handling hairpin routing requests.

Patches USN-3012-1, USN-3010-1, and CVE-2016-4450. Additional info can be found at https://pivotal.io/security.

Also introduces a fix for GoRouter to address an issue where failover of requests to unresponsive app instances was not working properly whenever the request has a body. See [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1358110/stories/118532589) for details.

Also increases the default instance size of the UAA instance to handle larger logs.

## 1.7.10

Updates the Cloud Foundry CLI used by the Pivotal Notifications and Autoscaling system applications, to address an issue where the errands that push these apps may sometimes fail on an environment with higher network latency.

This also patches Diego to increase the log-streamer message size from 4 Kb to 60 Kb. See [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111866195) for details. 

## 1.7.9

Patches USN-3020-1. Additional info can be found at https://pivotal.io/security.

This also addresses an issue with Loggregator not properly setting timeouts on TCP connections to Cloud Controller and UAA.

## v1.7.8 Patch

This also addresses an issue with rare occurrences of application containers being assigned duplicate IP addresses.

## v1.7.4 Patch

This only patches the CF CLI version used to push the Elastic Runtime system apps, like Apps Manager, to be more reliable. You do not need to upgrade to this version if you're already at Elastic Runtime 1.7.3.

## v1.7.3 Patch

As part of this release, there is a checkbox in the Elastic Runtime tile configuration that asks for every operator/administrator of the deployment to acknowledge that they understand how to implement application security groups successfully to secure their deployments. More info about this topic can be found here, in the [Application Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) topic of our documentation.

This also introduces a few bug fixes, including a patch to Diego to prevent rare occurances of the route-emitter locking up, another patch to Diego to prevent Diego BBS contention issues, added AWS regions to the Region field dropdown in the S3 option for file storage to enable selection of other regions using a V4 S3 endpoint, a patch for UAA to fix a bug introduced by Elastic Runtime 1.7.2 that broke using external LDAP over SSL, and a patch to the Elastic Runtime tile user-interface for custom branding to perform better when entering base-64 encoded images for your company logos. 

## v1.7.2 Patch

Patches USN-2977-1 and CVE-2016-3084. Additional info can be found at https://pivotal.io/security. Also increases the maximum length you can have for CF task commands and ensures greater reliability for etcd.

Introduces an option to configure security event tracking in the Cloud Controller logs. Also adds statsd metrics from Cloud Controller.

Also patches USN-2959-1, USN-2957-1, USN-2949-1, USN-2943-1, and USN-2935-2. Additional info can be found at https://pivotal.io/security.

If you are using Single Sign-On 1.1.0, it is recommended that you update to Single Sign-On 1.1.1. Additional info can be found at http://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/release-notes.html.

# Version 1.7.0 New Features

## Elastic Runtime

### Diego completely replaces DEAs

Before you upgrade to Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7, you must migrate all apps that are currently running on DEA architecture to run on Diego architecture. Pivotal does not support DEA architecture in Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7. You may need to scale up your VMs before migrating applications. More information can be found [here](../../adminguide/apps-enable-diego.html).

If you have any issues migrating your applications to Diego, please contact Support.

### Elastic Runtime Tile UI Changes

The tile has been re-designed in layout to improve the configuration workflow for operators. Several configuration fields have been moved to different sections of the tile. Also, more advanced logic has been implemented for some sections to make configuring complicated networking use cases easier for operators.

### Compiled Releases

Installs and upgrades of Elastic Runtime are now much faster than before, as the installation now makes use of compiled binaries instead of source code.

### Automated Backups

Operators using Pivotal Elastic Runtime can enable automatic backup on S3-compatible blobstores. This feature can be enabled for ERT running AWS, OpenStack, or vSphere.

Please see [this topic](../../customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf.html#backup-mysql) for more information.

### Docker Private Registries

Please see [this topic](../../opsguide/docker-registry.html) for information on Docker Trusted and Private registries.

### Unused Docker Image Cleanup

In the Application Containers configuration section of Elastic Runtime, you can configure how aggressively unused Docker Image files are removed from disk on Diego Cell VMs. The advantage to cleaning up less frequently is that subsequent push/scale events for Docker Images that have previously been run on the platform may be faster, since the image does not need to be downloaded from the Docker registry again. The "Threshold of Disk-Used (MB)" value refers to the total size of all Docker Images (whether in use or not) on an individual Cell VM.

### Route Services
Route Services are a new kind of Marketplace Service that developers can use to apply various transformations to application requests by binding an application’s route to a service instance. Through integrations with service brokers and optionally with the Cloud Foundry routing tier, providers can offer these services to developers with a familiar automated, self-service, and on-demand user experience.

Please see [this topic](../../services/route-services.html) for more information.

### Space Scoped Private Brokers
Space scoped private brokers allow a space developer to create and manage a service broker and scope it to a single space in order to allow faster iteration on service brokers without requiring full admin privileges.

Please see the [managing service brokers](../../services/managing-service-brokers.html) topic for more information.
This feature can be managed with the `space_scoped_private_broker_creation` cloud controller feature flag.

### Experimental Feature: Disk and Memory Overcommit Settings

If your apps do not use the full allocation of disk space and memory set in the <strong>Resource Config</strong> tab, you may want use this feature. These fields control the amount to overcommit disk and memory resources to assign more memory and disk space to each Diego Cell VM.

Please see [this topic](../../customizing/cloudform-er-config.html#experimental-features) for more information.

### Experimental Feature: Diego Tasks

Although you can use the V3 Tasks API to run asynchronous tasks, Pivotal reserves
the right to change this API or truncate the data about past task runs. For more
information about running one-off tasks in Cloud Foundry, see the
[Cloud Foundry V3 API Docs](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/release-candidate/index.html#tasks).

### AWS Cloudformation Script Update

You can now specify whether you would like to enable HTTP traffic to port 80 of your ELB if you are setting up an environment in AWS to deploy PCF.

### App Manager White Labeling
Pivotal Cloud Foundry® operators can now visually brand Apps Manager by changing certain text, colors, and images of the interface. Developers will see the customized interface when logging in, creating an account, resetting a password, or using Apps Manager.

Please see [this topic](../../opsguide/custom-branding.html) for more information.

##  Identity (aka UAA Server)

### UAA PW Policy Config in ERT

Operators can now specify some password policies in the UAA section of Elastic Runtime, including password length, specific character type requirements, expiration, and maximum password attempts allowed.

Please see [this topic](../../opsguide/pw-policy.html) for more information.

### UAA SAML features
Please see [this topic](../../opsguide/auth-sso.html) for more information.

### UAA Token Lifetime Settings
Please see [this topic](../../customizing/cloudform-er-config.html#er-auth-config) for more information.
