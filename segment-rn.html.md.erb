## <a id='intro'></a> About PCF Isolation Segment

The PCF Isolation Segment v1.12 tile is available for installation with PCF
v1.12.

<!----
[Isolation segments](../concepts/security.html#isolation-segments) provide
dedicated pools of resources where you can deploy apps and  isolate workloads.
Using isolation segments separates app resources as completely as if they were
in different CF deployments but avoids redundant management and network
complexity.

For more information about using isolation segments in your deployment, see the
[Managing Isolation Segments](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html) topic.
