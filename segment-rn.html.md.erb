## <a id='intro'></a> About PCF Isolation Segment

PCF Isolation Segment is a new tile available for installation with PCF v.1.10.

[Isolation segments](../concepts/security.html#isolation-segments) provide dedicated pools of resources where you can deploy apps and  isolate workloads. Using isolation segments separates app resources as completely as if they were in different CF deployments but avoids redundant management and network complexity.

For more information on using isolation segments in your deployment, see the [Managing Isolation Segments](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html) topic.

## <a id='install'></a> How to Install

The procedure for installing PCF Isolation Segment v1.10 is documented in the
[Installing PCF Isolation Segment](../opsguide/installing-pcf-is.html) topic.

To install a PCF Isolation Segment, you must first install PCF v1.10.

## <a id='adv-features'></a> About Advanced Features

The Advanced Features section of the PCF Isolation Segment tile includes new functionality that may have certain constraints.
Although these features are fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in production.
