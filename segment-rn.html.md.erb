## <a id='intro'></a> About PCF Isolation Segment

The PCF Isolation Segment v1.11 tile is available for installation with PCF
v1.11.

[Isolation segments](../concepts/security.html#isolation-segments) provide
dedicated pools of resources where you can deploy apps and  isolate workloads.
Using isolation segments separates app resources as completely as if they were
in different CF deployments but avoids redundant management and network
complexity.

For more information on using isolation segments in your deployment, see the
[Managing Isolation Segments](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html) topic.

## <a id='install'></a> How to Install

The procedure for installing PCF Isolation Segment v1.11 is documented in the
[Installing PCF Isolation Segment](../opsguide/installing-pcf-is.html) topic.

To install a PCF Isolation Segment, you must first install PCF v1.11.

## <a id='adv-features'></a> About Advanced Features

The Advanced Features section of the PCF Isolation Segment tile includes new
functionality that may have certain constraints.  Although these features are
fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in production.

## <a id='1.11.0'></a> New Features in PCF Isolation Segment v1.11.0

This section describes new features of the release.

### <a id='override-dns'></a> Override DNS Servers

By default, containers use the same DNS servers as the host. If you want to
override the DNS servers to be used in the containers in the isolation segment,
enter a comma-separated list of servers in the **DNS Servers** in the
**Application Containers** section of the tile.

### <a id='nfs3-vol-services'></a> NFSv3 Volume Services

The tile supports NFSv3 volume services. NFS volume services allow application
developers to bind existing NFS volumes to their applications for shared file
access. For more information, see the [Enabling NFS Volume
Services](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/opsguide/enable-vol-services.html)
topic.

To enable it, select **Enable** under **Enabling NFSv3 volume services** in the
**Application Containers** section of the tile.

In a clean install of the tile, NFSv3 volume services will be enabled by
default. In an upgrade, NFSv3 volume services will be set to the same setting
as it was in the previous tile.

### <a id='container-to-container'></a> Container-to-Container Networking

The tile supports container-to-container-networking. To enable
container-to-container networking, select **Enable** under **Enabling the
Container-to-Container network** in the **Networking** section of the tile and
complete the corresponding fields. For more information about
container-to-container networking, see the [Understanding
Container-to-Container
Networking](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/concepts/understand-cf-networking.html)
topic.

### <a id='syslog'></a> System Logging

The Isolation Segment now emits BOSH component logs in a common syslog format
following RFC5424.  Additionally, syslog over TLS is now supported to allow
operators to deliver their platform logs securely to their syslog aggregator.

The tile has a **System Logging** section that enables operators to configure
syslog for the VMs deployed within the tile.

### <a id='sha2'></a>SHA2 Checksum

Operators can verify the data integrity of the PCF Isolation Segment tile using
the file's SHA2 checksum, rather than the MD5 checksum that was used in
previous releases.

### <a id='local-route-emitter'></a> Cell-local Route Emitters

In previous versions of the Isolation Segment tile, the Diego Cells relied upon
the Route Emitter component on the Diego Brain in the Elastic Runtime Tile to
notify the Router of application routes.  When the Route Emitter becomes
unavailable, routes can be lost in the Router route table. In order to improve
the availability of the Route Emitter and reduce the impact of downtime from
this component, the Route Emitter is now colocated on the Diego Cell for which
it emits application routes.
