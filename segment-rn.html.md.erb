## <a id='intro'></a> About PCF Isolation Segment

The PCF Isolation Segment v2.0 tile is available for installation with PCF
v2.0.

<!----
[Isolation segments](../concepts/security.html#isolation-segments) provide
dedicated pools of resources where you can deploy apps and  isolate workloads.
Using isolation segments separates app resources as completely as if they were
in different CF deployments but avoids redundant management and network
complexity.

For more information about using isolation segments in your deployment, see the
[Managing Isolation Segments](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html) topic.

## <a id='install'></a> How to Install

<!----
The procedure for installing PCF Isolation Segment v2.0 is documented in the
[Installing PCF Isolation Segment](../customizing/installing-pcf-is.html) topic.---->

To install a PCF Isolation Segment, you must first install PCF v2.0.

## <a id='2.0.0'></a> New Features in PCF Isolation Segment v2.0.0

### <a id='mutual-tls'></a> Gorouter and HAProxy Trust the Diego Instance Identity Intermediate CA

The trust between the Gorouter and HAProxy enables mutual authentication between applications that are running on PCF. The Gorouter and HAProxy are configured with the root certificate authority. This occurs automatically within PCF.

### <a id='custom-ca'></a> Gorouter and HAProxy Trust Additional CAs

When validating client requests using mutual TLS, the Gorouter trusts multiple certificate authorities (CAs) by default. Operators can now configure the Gorouter and HAProxy to trust custom CAs in addition to well-known, public CAs and [Ops Manager Director Trusted Certificates](../customizing/gcp-om-config.html#security). For more information about configuring this feature, see the [Installing PCF Isolation Segment](../customizing/installing-pcf-is.html#networking) topic.

### <a id='multiple-cert'></a> Gorouter and HAProxy Support Multiple Certificates

You can now add more than one certificate for Gorouter and HAProxy in the **Networking** configuration pane. This improves security and removes the need to reissue the existing certificate when you want to add TLS support for custom domains. Gorouter and HAProxy use SNI to determine the correct certificate to present in a TLS handshake. For more information, see the [Multiple Certificates](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#multcerts) section of _Securing Traffic into Cloud Foundry_.

### <a id='haproxy-xfcc'></a> XFCC Support for Deployments that Terminate TLS at HAProxy 

PCF now supports XFCC header configuration for deployments that terminate TLS for the first time at HAProxy. In addition, the selection options for this configuration field have been renamed to reflect differences in XFCC configuration based on TLS termination entry points. For more information about configuring this feature, see the [Installing PCF Isolation Segment](../customizing/installing-pcf-is.html#networking) topic.

### <a id='nsx'></a>VMware NSX-T Networking Support

PCF v2.0 adds support for VMware NSX-T networking.
Previous versions of PCF supported NSX-V networking.

To enable NSX-T networking for your PCF installation, you must perform the following steps:

1. In the Ops Manager Director tile > **vCenter Config** pane, select **NSX-T** from the **NSX Mode** drop-down menu. See [Step 2: vCenter Config Page](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#vcenter-config) in _Configuring Ops Manager on vSphere_ for more information.

1. Install the NSX-T tile. 
  - You must install the NSX-T tile after you install or upgrade the Ops Manager Director tile.
  - You must install the NSX-T tile before you install or upgrade the PAS tile.

1. In the PAS tile > **Networking** pane, under **Container Network Plugin Interface**. select **External**.

See the [NSX-T Container Plug-in for Kubernetes and Cloud
Foundry - Installation and Administration Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod.tracker2/resource/85792716/nsxt_21_ncp_kubernetes-1127.pdf) for more information.

## <a id='adv-features'></a> About Advanced Features

The Advanced Features section of the PCF Isolation Segment tile includes new
functionality that may have certain constraints.  Although these features are
fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in production.
