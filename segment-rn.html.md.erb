## <a id='intro'></a> About PCF Isolation Segment

The PCF Isolation Segment v1.12 tile is available for installation with PCF
v1.12.

[Isolation segments](../concepts/security.html#isolation-segments) provide
dedicated pools of resources where you can deploy apps and  isolate workloads.
Using isolation segments separates app resources as completely as if they were
in different CF deployments but avoids redundant management and network
complexity.

For more information about using isolation segments in your deployment, see the
[Managing Isolation Segments](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html) topic.

## <a id='install'></a> How to Install

The procedure for installing PCF Isolation Segment v1.12 is documented in the
[Installing PCF Isolation Segment](../opsguide/installing-pcf-is.html) topic.

To install a PCF Isolation Segment, you must first install PCF v1.12.

## <a id='adv-features'></a> About Advanced Features

The Advanced Features section of the PCF Isolation Segment tile includes new
functionality that may have certain constraints.  Although these features are
fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in production.

## <a id='1.12.0'></a> New Features in PCF Isolation Segment v1.12.0

This section describes new features of the release.

### Diego Cell Max-in-Flight Default

The max-in-flight percentage for the Diego Cell job in the Isolation Segment
has been set to 10% since 1.10, but we've seen especially in larger
environments that having the percentage this high can cause some problems:

* Many simultaneous VM creates/deletes and BOSH blob updates can place
significant stress on the underlying infrastructure, especially on vSphere
which has a greater probability of being under-provisioned.
* The cells that are draining are no longer available for allocation, resulting
in a 10% decrease in total memory and disk capacity during the deployment. This
can cause deployments to no longer have sufficient total capacity to run all
the work, or to have insufficient headroom to place larger workloads
successfully.

For these reasons, we have lowered the default max-in-flight percentage on the
Diego Cells to 4%. Operators can still use the Ops Manager API to configure
this setting to fit their needs.
