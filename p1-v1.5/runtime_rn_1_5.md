title: Pivotal Elastic Runtime v1.5.0.0 Release Notes
---

## Changes since v1.4.0.0:

## Elastic Runtime

### New Features

#### Default Stack: cflinuxfs2

New deployments will no longer have the lucid64 stack available.

Operators are encouraged to migrate all apps to cflinuxfs2 as mentioned in the v1.4 release notes.

A future release will completely remove the lucid64 stack from Pivotal Cloud Foundry and after upgrading to this subsequent release, apps that have not been migrated to cflinuxfs2 will fail to start.

Further details can be found here: https://support.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/205751277-New-cflinuxfs2-Stack

#### Security Configuration of Runtime

This new section allows configuration of security settings for your Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime components, such as HAProxy, Router, and the DEAs.

By checking the ???? checkbox, all port 80 traffic to HAProxy will be rejected and the VCAP_ID cookie generated by the GoRouter will have the secure flag enabled. If this checkbox is checked and you're deployment is not using HAProxy, your external load balancer should be configured to not accept port 80 traffic.  If this is not done, traffic to port 80 will still be forwarded applications but would lose session stickiness.

By checking the ???? checkbox, self-signed SSL certificates used by HAProxy or your external load balancer. 

By checking the ???? checkbox, it disables a restriction on the DEA that disallows containers on a particular DEA from communicating with each other.  It is not recommended to check this checkbox for multi-tenant environments.  

This section also includes fields which allow setting of the HAProxy SSL certificate, HAProxy cipher string, and GoRouter cipher string. 

The HAProxy SSL certificate field is now an optional field.

Custom cipher strings for HAProxy and GoRouter are also optional fields.

#### Other Runtime Features

##### S3-Compatible Filestore Configuration

OpenStack allows for use of an external filestore that is compatible with Amazon's AWS S3 buckets. You can now choose whether you want to deploy Pivotal Elastic Runtime using an internal filestore or an external S3-compatible bucket, whether it is hosted by AWS or Openstack.

If using an external filestore, you can configure the URL endpoint of your S3-compatible filestore under the File Storage Config section. For example, if you are using AWS S3, you can keep this field configured with the default value https://s3.amazonaws.com. Note that this default points to US East region.

#### Improved MySQL Service
MySQL, used by Notifications, Autoscaling, and Apps Manager, ... explain switchboard + improved failure recovery

#### API/cf CLI

A space developer can create a wildcard route for private domains.  Previously, only admins were allowed to create wildcard routes.

`cf create-route SPACE DOMAIN -n "*"`

For example, you could create a wildcard route *.example.com to be mapped to a special 404 app called my404app and myapp.example.com to be mapped to myapp.
Traffic to myapp.example.com would be routed to myapp and traffic to unknown.example.com would be routed to my404app.
