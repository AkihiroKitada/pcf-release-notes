title: Pivotal Cloud Foundry Ops Manager v1.5.0.0 Known Issues
---

## New Issues

Some of these issues may be fixed in subsequent patch releases to 1.5. Consult the Ops Manager 1.5 [Release Notes](opsmanager_rn_1_5.html) for more information.

* **Important note for vCloud Director (vCD) and vCloud Air (vCA) users**: Upgrading your vCD to 6.4 or later, or upgrading your vCA to any version that uses API version 6.0 or higher, will break all versions of PCF. VMware and Pivotal are aware of this issue and are working on a fix. Pivotal recommends that you delay upgrading vCD or vCA until this problem is fully resolved. If you must upgrade, please contact Pivotal Support first for additional guidance.
* Ops Manager 1.5 does not support AWS S3 buckets in `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) due to an issue with Amazon's authentication APIs in this region. Therefore, Pivotal does not recommend customers use the `eu-central-1` region for deployments that require high performance.
* On AWS environments that were initialized with our CloudFormation template, by default it is only possible to use "light-bosh" stemcells. If you need to use a full (non-light) stemcell, you must first enable the `ec2:RegisterImage` privilege for your Ops Manager's IAM user.
* If you are using OpenStack Juno, make sure you have applied this patch:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1394051](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1394051)

## Existing issues

* DNS and Gateway ICMP errors will occur on AWS even if ICMP is allowed.
* Resource Pools cannot be deleted from Availability Zones. If a resource pool is inadvertently deleted, run `BOSH recreate`.
* Compiled Packages are missing from installation exports, which can cause a failure if the product contained and referenced them. A fix is to SSH into the Ops Manager VM and remove references to `compiled_packages` in every file located in the `/var/tempest/workspace/metadata` directory.
* PCF products with Ruby BOSH Agent stemcells must be upgraded prior to importing into this version of Ops Manager.
* IP reassignment must be handled by scaling a job down to zero instances and re-entering new IP addresses before scaling the job back up.
* Unnecessary job instances must be reduced manually (MySQL, HA Proxy if RDS & ELBs are used).
* Before upgrading tiles on Ops Manager 1.4 or earlier, Pivotal recommends that you increase the size of Ops Manager Directorâ€™s persistent disk to at least 40 GB. (This is the default in Ops Manager 1.5.) To change the size of the persistent disk, navigate to **Ops Manager Director tile -> Resource Config -> Ops Man Director -> Persistent Disk (MB)**.
* Ops Manager does not support the installation of Pivotal HD.
