## New Issues for 1.6.X
Some of these issues may be fixed in subsequent patch releases to 1.6. Consult the Ops Metrics 1.6 [Release Notes](opsmetrics_rn_1_6.html) - any additional fixes will be added immediately.

For all 1.6.X releases:

* To fix the possibility of installation deadlock with Elastic Runtime 1.6.X, the OpenTSDB Firehose Nozzle job (responsible for receiving Diego metric data) has been disabled by default.
* There is nothing that prevents the user from turning on the Nozzle deployment when Elastic Runtime is not present.
  * Enabling the nozzle when Elastic Runtime is not deployed or enabled will produce the following error:
  * "RuntimeError - unknown product 'cf' in (( ..cf.cloud\_controller.system_domain.value ))"
  * To fix this, reduce the number of nozzle counts to zero until Elastic Runtime is enabled.
* Because deploying the OpenTSDB firehose nozzle is now optional, smoke tests for Elastic Runtime have been disabled until a later release.

For the 1.6.0 release:

* Leaving the port blank in Elastic Runtime would cause the OpenTSDB firehose nozzle to try to listen to port 0.   To fix, enter port 443 in Elastic Runtime or use Ops Metrics 1.6.1 .
