## <a id='major-features'></a>New Features in Ops Manager v2.2

### <a id='multi-dc'></a> Multiple Data Centers on vSphere

Ops Manager now allows you to configure multiple vSphere data centers to a single BOSH Director. You can add additional data centers in the **vSphere Config** pane of your vSphere BOSH Director tile.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>If you use the Ops Manager API and multiple vSphere configs exist, the GET HTTP request for Director properties omits the <code>iaas_configuration</code> key. For more information about the API request, see <a target="_blank" href="http://opsman-dev-api-docs.cfapps.io/#fetching-director-iaas-and-security-properties-experimental">Fetching director, IaaS, and security properties</a> in the Ops Manager API documentation.</p>

### <a id="om-credhub"></a> Ops Manager Credentials Stored in CredHub

On each **Apply Changes**, Ops Manager sends your user-specified credentials to BOSH CredHub. This feature offers greater security for your credentials. For more information about where Ops Manager stores your credentials, see [BOSH CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/credhub/index.html#bosh).

For information about how this feature affects tile authors, see [PCF v2.2 Partners Release Notice](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-2/release-notes-2-2.html#om-credhub) in the _PCF Tile Developer Guide_.

### <a id="custom-ssl"></a> Specify a Custom Trusted SSL Certificate

Operators can specify a custom trusted SSL certificate and key for the Ops Manager server so that traffic isn't exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks when using Ops Manager.

By default, Ops Manager uses an auto-generated self-signed certificate. To change this configuration to your own SSL certificate, navigate to **Settings** from the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and select the **SSL Certificate** pane to enter your **Certificate** and **Private Key**.

For more information about navigating the Ops Manager Settings page, see [Settings Page](http://docs.pivotal.io/customizing/pcf-interface.html#settings) in the _Understanding the Ops Manager Interface_ topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Custom SSL certificate and key is persisted between upgrades. Custom SSL only needs a one-time configuration.</p>

### <a id="tls-blobstore"></a> TLS for Internal Blobstore Supported

Ops Manager now supports TLS communications if you choose to use an internal blobstore.

To enable internal blobstore TLS communication, all of your tiles must have stemcells v3468 or later. If your tiles meet this requirement, disable the **Allow Legacy Agents** checkbox in the **Director Config** pane of your BOSH Director tile.

### <a id="excluded-recursors"></a> Specify Excluded Recursors

In the **Director Config** pane, you can now enter **Excluded Recursors** as a comma-separated list. This list specifies which IPs and ports you want to exclude from the DNS server. For more information, see [Director Config Page](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/customizing/gcp-om-config.html#director-config).

## <a id="known-issues"></a> Known Issues

No known issues at this time.
