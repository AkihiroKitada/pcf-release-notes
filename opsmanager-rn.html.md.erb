## <a id='major-features'></a>New Features in Ops Manager v1.12.0

### <a id='google-xpn'></a>Google Shared Virtual Private Cloud

Google Shared Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), formerly known as Google Cross-Project Networking (XPN), enables you to assign GCP resources
to individual projects within an organization but allows communication and shared services between projects.
For more information about this feature, see the [Configuring a Shared VPC on GCP](./customizing/gcp-shared-vpc.html) topic.

### <a id='credhub-migration'></a>Migrate Non-Configurable Secrets to CredHub

Tile Authors can write a JavaScript migration to move their existing non-configurable secrets into CredHub.
Ops Manager v1.12 supports migrating `secret`, `simple_credential`, and `rsa_pkey_credential` types.
For more information about this feature, see the [Migrating Existing Credentials to CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/migrating-credhub-credentials.html)
topic in the PCF Tile Developers Guide.
