## <a id='major-features'></a>New Features in Ops Manager v2.0

### <a id='rbac'></a>Role-Based Access Control

Ops Manager 2.0 introduces support for role-based access control (RBAC).
You can assign the **Ops Manager Administrator**, **Full Control**, or **Restricted Control** roles to determine which operators in your organization make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in Ops Manager.

See [Configuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Ops Manager](../opsguide/config-rbac.html) for more information.

### <a id='ssh-banner'></a>Custom Director Login Banner

In Ops Manager 2.0, operators can set a custom banner that every user sees when they log in to the Ops Manager BOSH Director.
To set the banner, edit the **Custom SSH Banner** field in the **Director Config** page of the Ops Manager tile.

See the Director configuration topic for your IaaS for more information.
For example, see [Configuring Ops Manager on vSphere](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#dir-config).

### <a id='azure-stack'></a>Azure Stack Support (Beta)

Operators can deploy Ops Manager 2.0 to Microsoft Azure in their own local datacenter using Azure Stack.

See [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Azure without an ARM Template](../customizing/azure-om-deploy.html) for more information.

### <a id='bosh-cli'></a>BOSH CLI Renamed

Similar to previous Ops Manager versions, the Ops Manager VM includes both versions of the BOSH CLI.
In Ops Manager v2.0, both versions of the BOSH CLI have been renamed.

If you used BOSH CLI v2 in earlier versions of Ops Manager, you ran commands using `bosh2`.
In Ops Manager v2.0.0, run the same commands using `bosh`.
For example, see the following table to compare the changes to the `bosh vms` command:

| **BOSH CLI Version** | **PCF v1.12** | **PCF v2.0** |
|----------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **BOSH CLI v1** | `bosh vms` | `bosh-old vms` |
| **BOSH CLI v2** | `bosh2 -e MY-ENV vms` | `bosh -e MY-ENV vms`

Many BOSH CLI v1 commands are incompatible with the BOSH Director.
Pivotal recommends using BOSH CLI v2 commands for compatibility with future versions of PCF.

### <a id='nats-over-tls'></a>BOSH NATS Traffic Uses TLS

The BOSH Director communicates with the agents in your deployment over NATS.
For added security, Ops Manager 2.0 sends all NATS traffic using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.

See [Component: Messaging (NATS)](../concepts/architecture/messaging-nats.html) for more information about NATS.

### <a id='colocated-errands'></a>Configure Colocated Errands

Tile authors can configure the errands defined in their product tile to run on existing VMs in a deployment.
Colocated errands run faster than traditional errands and use fewer resources, including disk and IP space.

See [Tile Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#colocated) in the PCF Tile Developers Guide for more information.

### <a id='runtime-config'></a>Configure Tiles with Runtime Configs

Tile authors can include `runtime_configs` as a top-level key in tile metadata to define global deployment configurations. Named runtime config settings apply to all VMs in a deployment.

Version 2.0.0 of Ops Manager supports defining any number of `runtime_configs` in an existing tile. Tile authors can also create a tile that includes a runtime config only and does not define any job types or errands.

See [Managing Runtime Configs](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/runtime-config.html) in the PCF Tile Developers Guide for more information.
