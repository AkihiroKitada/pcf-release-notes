## <a id='major-features'></a> New Features in Ops Manager v2.3

Ops Manager v2.3 includes the following major features:

### <a id="xenial"></a> Ops Manager and BOSH Director Upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Zerus)

Ops Manager and BOSH Director stemcells run on Ubuntu 16.04, "Xenial Zerus." This Long Term Support (LTS) release is valid through April 2021. 

### <a id="bosh-dns">BOSH DNS is Required

BOSH DNS is enabled by default in PCF 2.3. 

The option to disable BOSH DNS is no longer available in the Ops Manager UI or API.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Upgrades to PCF 2.3 will fail if BOSH DNS is disabled. Enable BOSH DNS before upgrading to PCF 2.3.</p>

### <a id="bosh-dns-certs">BOSH DNS Certificate Authority Upgrades

BOSH DNS now comes with CAs that are valid for four years. These CAs will apply automatically when upgrading to 2.3.

To apply the CAs completely, you must upgrade to PCF 2.3 and then rotate all certificates in your installation. Follow the procedure below to rotate your certificates:

1. Upgrade Ops Manager to 2.3
1. Click **Apply Changes** to distribute new CA to all VMs. Do not use **Review Pending Changes** to update your installation incrementally. Upgrade all tiles simultaneously.
1. Use the Ops Manager API to `POST /api/v0/certificate_authorities/active/regenerate`.
1. **Apply Changes** for all tiles simultaneously to rotate the certificates.

### <a id="ldap"></a>Ops Manager Supports LDAP Authentication

Lightweight Directory Access Protocal (LDAP) authentication is now available. It joins the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) as one of two authentication methods Ops Manager supports.

**Admins**: Enable LDAP or SAML authentication through the _Settings_ page.

**Operators:** Configure LDAP settings on the _Set Up_ page for new installations of Ops Manager.

### <a id="cinder"></a> Virtual Machines Running on OpenStack Can Boot From Cinder Volumes

If you use OpenStack, you can now boot virtual machines (VMs) from a Cinder volume. Cinder is an opensource block storage solution for OpenStack users. Access this option from the OpenStack _IaaS Config_ page. 

### <a id="persistent-disk">Recreate Persistent Disks for Specific Installations

Operators can now recreate all persistent disks for an installation by selecting a checkbox in the _Director Config_ page. On next **Apply Changes**, this feature recreates the persistent disks for the BOSH Director, the BOSH Director VM, and all tiles.

### <a id="review-pending-changes"></a> UI Improvements to Review Pending Changes 

The _Review Pending Changes_ page in the Ops Manager installation dashboard features UI improvements.

See the following changes:

- You now cannot enable orange tiles for selective deployment. In Ops Manager v2.2, you can enable orange tiles but you cannot click **Apply Changes**.
- When you enable a tile for selective deployment, its dependencies are also enabled. In Ops Manager v2.2, you must enable your tile dependencies manually.
- When an update fails, a list of pending changes that did not complete appears on the _Review Pending Changes_ page.
- When you attempt to change a tile with an out-of-date stemcell, a message appears notifying you that the stemcell is out of date. Click this message to access the Stemcell Library.
- When a tile is staged to be deleted, indicator text appears on that tile.
- **Apply Changes** displays as **Review Pending Changes** when there are pending changes staged.
- Stemcell changes appear in the _Changes_ field for each tile.
- When _Review Pending Changes_ returns an error, the error message includes the name of the affected tiles.
- The "Beta" label no longer appears on the _Review Pending Changes_ page.
- The _Review Pending Changes_ page has minor UI improvements throughout.

For more information about the page UI, see [Review Pending Changes Page](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/review-pending-changes.html#review-pending-changes).

### <a id="review-pending-changes-api"></a> API Improvements to Review Pending Changes

- You can use `GET /api/v0/staged/pending_changes` to see stemcell changes in the Ops Manager API.
- When the API returns an error, the error message includes the name of the affected products.
- When an update fails, you can use `GET /api/v0/staged/pending_changes` to see a list of pending changes that did not complete.

For more information about the Review Pending Changes API endpoints, see the [Ops Manager API documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/).
