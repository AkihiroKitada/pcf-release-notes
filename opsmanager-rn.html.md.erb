## <a id='major-features'></a>New Features in Ops Manager v1.11.0

### <a id='ops-man-api'></a>Ops Manager API

Operators can now use the API to trigger an installation process only for Ops Manager Director, skipping the deployment of all other products that have pending changes in Ops Manager. For more information about using this Ops Manager API feature, see the[Applying Changes to Ops Manager Director](../customizing/deploy-ops-man-director.html)topic.

### <a id='logging'></a>Improved Logging for the Ops Manager VM

Ops Manager v1.11.0 logs all activity of commands on the Ops Manager VM using Audit D. 

### <a id='vm-hardening'></a>Ops Manager VM Hardening

The OpsManager VM is now built on the stemcell. For enhanced security to maintain consistency with industry standards, Ops Manager VMs should now pass security scans with the same success rates as other BOSH-deployed VMs.

### <a id='nsx-integration'></a>NSX Integration

Operators can use OpsManager 1.11 to configure their Bosh Director to talk to NSX. Ops Manager 1.11 supports NSX-V 6.2+.

OpsManager has API endpoints to configure NSX security groups and load balancers on vSphere appliances. For more information on this feature, see the [Configuring Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#vcenter-config) topic.

### <a id='azure-managed'></a>Azure Managed Disk
OpsManager now allows operators to deploy using Azure's new fully managed storage service. With this new service, users no longer have to manually manage their storage capacity. For more information on how to use the managed disk feature, see the [Configuring Ops Manager Director on Azure](../customizing/azure-om-config.html) topic.


### <a id='errands'></a>BOSH CLI v2 Support

Ops Manager v1.11.0 supports both the BOSH CLI v1 and the BOSH CLI v2. You can use either version of the CLI to manage your deployment. For more information about the BOSH CLI v2, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html) topic.

### <a id='bosh'></a> BOSH Updates

#### BOSH Director
Ops Manager v1.11.0 uses BOSH v262, which includes the following changes to the BOSH Director:

+ <b>Worker Configuration:</b> Operators can now configure the number of workers that are available on the BOSH Director.
+ <b>JMX Provider IP Address:</b> The Director Configuration form in OpsManager now includes a new field called JMX Provider IP Address that configures the JMX JSON plugin for secure transportation of metrics. 
+ <b>API Endpoints:</b> Operators can use OpsManager API endpoints to view credentials that are stored in CredHub. For more information on how to do this visit the [Fetching Variable Names and Values
](../credhub/credhub-api-variables.html) topic.

For a full list of updates and fixes in the new BOSH version that Ops Manager uses, see the [BOSH release notes](https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh?all=1), beginning with [v262](https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh?version=262).
