## <a id='major-features'></a>New Features in Ops Manager v2.1

### <a id="credhub-hsm"></a> Configure an External CredHub Encyption

In the **Director Config** pane of an installation, you now have the option to select a **CredHub Encryption Provider** to store your encryption keys. For Ops Manager v2.1, you only have the option to select internal encryption or a Luna Hardware Security Module (HSM). For more information on configuring your CredHub encryption provider, see [Director Config Page](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/gcp-om-config.html#director-config).

### <a id="multiple-logins"></a> Multiple Read-Only Users Can Be Logged in Simultaneously

Ops Manager users with **Full View** and **Restricted View** permissions can be logged in simultaneously. Previous to this change, only one user at a time could view Ops Manager.

For security purposes, operators with write access still cannot be logged into Ops Manager simultaneously. For more information on operator roles and permissions, see [Configuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Ops Manager](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/config-rbac.html).

### <a id="gcs-blobstore"></a> GCS Blobstore Available for External File Storage

You now have the option to select a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) blobstore as your external file storage. With this new feature, Pivotal now recommends you select the **GCS Blobstore** option for the **Blobstore Location** if you install Ops Manager with GCP. For more information, see the [Director Config Page](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/gcp-om-config.html#director-config) section of *Configuring Ops Manager Director on GCP*.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>After you deploy Ops Manager, you cannot change the blobstore location.</p>

### <a id="custom-vm-extensions"></a> Create Custom VM Extensions

You can create and manage custom VM extensions through the Ops Manager API. Custom VM extensions allow you to assign a group of IaaS-specific `cloud_properties` to a custom VM extension `name`. You can then assign this custom VM extension to jobs. For more information on custom VM extensions, see [Managing Custom VM Extensions](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/custom-vm-extensions.html).

### <a id="ip-discontinued"></a> IP Management Removed

Ops Manager no longer allows operators to allocate or manage IPs. Instead, only the BOSH Director manages IP allocation. This change is to keep IP management in one central location without redundancy. To learn more about BOSH Director and how it handles both networks and IPs, see [Dynamic Networks](https://bosh.io/docs/networks.html) in the BOSH documentation.

### <a id="custom-banner"></a> Custom Banner Available for Web Apps and Ops Manager

From the Ops Manager settings, you can now add a custom banner to communicate important messages to operators. In the new **Custom Banner** pane, enter text in the **Banner UI** field to create a banner that appears on each page of the Ops Manager UI. If you enter text in the **SSH Banner** field, that text appears to each operator who shells into Ops Manager. For more information about navigating Ops Manager settings, see [Settings Page](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/pcf-interface.html#settings).

### <a id="custom-kms"></a> Add Custom Encryption Key to AWS Installation

For Ops Manager for AWS, operators can specify a custom Key Management Service (KMS) encryption key to encrypt all the Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes in AWS. To specify a KMS Key, enable **Encrypt EBS Volumes** in the **AWS Config** pane and enter your key in the new **Custom Encryption Key** field. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon EBS Encryption](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/cloudform-om-ebs-config.html). 

### <a id="azure-application-gateway"></a> Integrate Azure Application Gateway Load Balancers

In the **Resource Config** pane of the Azure configuration dashboard, you can enter an Azure Application Gateway for your load balancer.

To learn more about Azure Application Gateway, see [Overview of Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-introduction) in the Azure documentation.

To learn more about configuring your load balancer for Azure, see the [Resource Config Page](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/azure-om-config.html#resource-config) section in the *Configuring Ops Manager on Azure* topic.

### <a id="multiple-clusters"></a> Add Multiple Clusters to Availability Zones

In the vSphere configuration dashboard, you can now add multiple clusters to an Availability Zone (AZ) with the new **Add Cluster** button. For more information on configuring AZs, see [Create Availability Zone Page](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/vsphere-config.html#create-az) in the _Configuring Ops Manager on vSphere_ topic.
