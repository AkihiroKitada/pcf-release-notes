The [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic contains instructions for upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

## <a id="releases"></a>Releases

Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following minor releases:

### <a id="alpha-2"></a> 2.6 Alpha 2

* **[New Feature]**: Operators using AWS-based deployments can choose between even more AWS regions in the AWS Config form. Deployments upgraded from v2.5 will default to the AWS region you chose for that deployment.
* **[New Feature]**: After a deployment fails, API users can use `POST /api/v0/installations` to see which products are not fully configured.
* **[New Feature]**: The Stemcell Library page now supports uploading and assigning multiple stemcells.
* **[New Feature]**: API users can assign one or multiple stemcells to a product using the multi-stemcell API, `PATCH api/v0/stemcells_assignments`. `GET api/v0/stemcells_assignments` returns information on all the stemcells assigned to products.
* **[New Feature]**: API users can use `api/v0/staged/pending_changes` to see the staged, deployed, and last successfully deployed stemcell information for all stemcells associated with a product.
* **[New Feature]**: API users can use `GET /api/v0/diagnostic_report` to show stemcells for all staged and deployed products.
* **[New Feature]**: The Change Log page has an improved UI, including a new column specifying build duration and a new footer row summarizing the installation details.
* **[New Feature]**: API users can use `GET /api/v0/staged/director/pre_deploy_check` to see details about the Director's configuration before deployment.
* **[New Feature]**: After a deployment fails, API users can use `/api/v0/staged/products/:PRODUCT-GUID/pre_deploy_check` to see which form verifiers in a product are causing the failure.
* **[New Feature]**: Tile authors can use a form and install time verifier to verify vSphere IaaS properties. 
* **[New Feature]**: Tile authors can upload tiles that support multiple stemcells. Use the `additional_stemcells_criteria` key to specify an array of additional stemcells available to tile operators. Choose a stemcell with the `stemcell_selector` property key included in `PUT api/v0/staged/products/:PRODUCT-GUID/properties`.
* **[New Feature]**: Tile authors can create and deploy their own manifests using non-default stemcells. Use a `stemcells` block in the manifest to specify an alias, OS, and version for a stemcell. Additionally, you can use the following double-parens accessors to see further details about stemcells: `(( my_stemcell_selector.os ))`, `(( my_stemcell_selector.version ))`, `(( my_stemcell_selector.assigned? ))`, `(( my_stemcell_selector.value ))`, (( my_stemcell_selector.value_present? ))`.
* **[Bug Fix]**: Ops Manager operators can no longer upload a duplicate stemcell to the Stemcell Library.
* **[Bug Fix]**: Ops Manager operators on vSphere-based deployments can now use spaces in the folder names for their vCenter config information.

### <a id="alpha-1"></a> 2.6 Alpha 1

* **[Breaking Change]**: (vSphere only) You can no longer ssh into a VM on a vSphere Ops Manager without a private key.
* **[New Feature]**: `GET /api/v0/installations` now displays the start and end time for a deployment of each product. Products that are upgraded from earlier versions of Ops Manager will display `null` for their start and end times.
* **[New Feature]**: Ops Manager operators cannot set secrets that do not match the constraints defined by the must_match_regex parameter.
* **[New Feature]**: Ops Manager supports 5th generation AWS Instance Types. 5th generation Instance Types are the default when a v2.6 Ops Manager boots.
* **[New Feature]**: You can now specify a monitor port when defining a NSX load balancer. Send a PUT to `/api/v0/staged/products/:guid/properties/jobs/:job_id/resource_config` with a  `monitor_port` key. This features helps to support NSX load balancer compatibility with Gorouter, which requires a monitor port of `8080` and a traffic port of `80`.  
* **[UI Improvement]**: The banner notifying you that certificates in your deployment will expire in the next three months is edited for improved clarity and usefulness.
