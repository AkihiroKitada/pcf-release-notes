This topic provides an overview of stemcells and the versions used in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) 2.0.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A stemcell is a versioned OS image that BOSH uses to create VMs for the Ops Manager Director, Pivotal Application Service (PAS), and other PCF Service tiles, such as MySQL for PCF.
