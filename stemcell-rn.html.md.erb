## <a id="3468-16"></a>3468.16

**Release Date**: January 10, 2018

- Bump Ubuntu Trusty stemcells for [USN-3522-2: Linux (Xenial HWE) vulnerability](https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3522-2/) (This flaw is known as Meltdown.)

### <a id='critical'></a> USN-3522-2 addresses Meltdown Vulnerabilities

Meltdown attacks exploit critical vulnerabilities in modern processors. 

This update may include degradations to performance if your VM's CPU and Memory usage are currently at near-capacity levels.
Prior to upgrading to these stemcells, monitor your PCF VM's current CPU and Memory usage and scale those components, if necessary. If any of your VMs are currently operating at 60% or above, we recommend scaling that VM.
For more information on monitoring PCF, please see the [Monitoring PCF VMs from Ops Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/monitoring.html) topic.
For more information on scaling PCF components, see the [Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) topic.
