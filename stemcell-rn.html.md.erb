**Release Date**: January 10, 2018

- Bumps Ubuntu Trusty stemcells for USN-3522-4; also bumps vSphere stemcells to use VM hardware version 9
- USN-3522-2 introduced a regression in the Linux Hardware Enablement kernel and USN-3522-4 fixes that issue.
- Per the 3445.21 release note, monitor your VMs prior to upgrading to these stemcells and scale your VMs as necessary. 

## <a id="3445-21"></a>3445.21

**Release Date**: January 10, 2018

- Bump Ubuntu Trusty stemcells for [USN-3522-2: Linux (Xenial HWE) vulnerability](https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3522-2/) (This flaw is known as Meltdown.)

### <a id='critical'></a> USN-3522-2 Addresses Meltdown Vulnerabilities

Meltdown exploits critical vulnerabilities in modern processors.
For more information on Meltdown, see the [Meltdown and Spectre Attacks](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/meltdown-spectre-attacks/) blog post.
[USN-3522-2](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/usn-3522-2/) addresses the critical vulnerability in Ubuntu associated with Meltdown.

This update may include degradations to performance if your VM's CPU and Memory usage are currently at near-capacity levels.
Prior to upgrading to these stemcells, monitor your PCF VM's current CPU and Memory usage and scale those components, if necessary. If any of your VMs are currently operating at 60% or above, Pivotal recommends scaling that VM.
For more information on monitoring PCF, please see the [Monitoring PCF VMs from Ops Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/monitoring.html) and [Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) topics.

For more information on scaling PCF, see the [Scaling PAS](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-0/opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html) topic.
Performance degradation is likely to vary by workload type, IaaS, and other factors. 
Pivotal recommends testing your deployment thoroughly after upgrading to this stemcell.
