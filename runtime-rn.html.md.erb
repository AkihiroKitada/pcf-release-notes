The procedure for upgrading to Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.6 is documented in the [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic.

When upgrading to PAS v2.6, be aware of the following upgrade considerations:

* If you previously used an earlier version of PAS, you must first upgrade to PAS v2.4 to successfully upgrade to PAS v2.6.

* Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v2.6. Pivotal is working with partners to ensure their tiles are updated to work with the latest versions of PCF.<br/><br/> For information about which partner service releases are currently compatible with PCF v2.6, review the appropriate partners services release documentation at [https://docs.pivotal.io](https://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner organization that produces the tile.
