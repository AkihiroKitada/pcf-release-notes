## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

The procedure for upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime v1.11 is documented in the
[Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic.

When upgrading to v1.11, be aware of the following upgrade considerations:

   * You must upgrade first to a version of Elastic Runtime v1.10.x in order to successfully upgrade to v1.11.
   * Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v1.11. Pivotal is working with partners to ensure their tiles are being updated to work with the latest versions of PCF.<br/><br/>
     For information about which partner service releases are currently compatible with PCF v1.11, review the
     appropriate partners services release documentation at [http://docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io), or
     contact the partner organization that produces the tile.
     
## <a id='adv-features'></a> About Advanced Features

The Advanced Features section of the Elastic Runtime tile includes new functionality that may have certain constraints.

Although these features are fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in production.

## <a id='1.11.0'></a> New Features in Elastic Runtime v1.11.0

This section describes new features of the release.

### <a id='apps-manager-508'></a> Apps Manager 508 Compliance

Apps Manager has improved its compliance with [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) of the Rehabilitation Act. Customers can now receive an approved Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) for Apps Manager.

### <a id='container-networking'></a> Container-to-Container Networking

The Container-to-Container Networking feature in Elastic Runtime is now generally available. For more information, see the [Container-to-Container Networking](../devguide/deploy-apps/cf-networking.html) topic.

### <a id='volume-services'></a> Volume Services

General support for volume services inside of application containers is now generally available. Additionally, the Elastic Runtime ships with an NFS Volume Service Broker.

For more information, see [Using an External File System (Volume Services)](../devguide/services/using-vol-services.html) and [Enabling NFS Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html).

### <a id='internal-uaa-expire'></a> UAA User Passwords Never Expire

As of v1.11, Elastic Runtime no longer provides the **Number of Months Before Password Expires** field in the **Authentication and Enterprise SSO** section. Instead, it sets the value to zero, which means that UAA user passwords for deployments using internal UAA never expire.

If you have set a non-zero password expiry, Elastic Runtime will set it to zero when you upgrade from v1.10 to v1.11.
