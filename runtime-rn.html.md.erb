## <a id='upgrade'></a>How to Upgrade

The procedure for upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime v1.9 is documented in the [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic. When upgrading to v1.9, be aware of the following upgrade considerations:

* Before upgrading to PCF v1.9, remove any product tiles that are no longer supported in PCF. See [Review and Remove Unsupported Products](../../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#remove-products).

* Some partner service tiles may currently be incompatible with PCF v1.9. Pivotal is working with partners to ensure their tiles are being updated to work with the latest versions of PCF. For information about which partner service releases are currently compatible with PCF v1.8, review the appropriate partners services release documentation at [http://docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner organization that produces the tile.

## <a id='1.9.0'></a> New Features in Elastic Runtime v1.9.0

### <a id='security'></a>Security Improvements for Intercomponent Communication

The etcd cluster now uses TLS for all communication between servers and clients.
To support the migration from unencrypted to encrypted communication, the existing etcd servers have been converted into proxies.
These proxies will allow connections from clients that still communicate unencrypted.
It is important to note that the etcd proxy will need to remain deployed until such time as all clients in your deployment have switched to encrypted communications.

Additionally, the Diego Cell VMs now provide a secured API endpoint to communicate with the Diego Brain VM.
The Cells will provide both encrypted and unencrypted channels of communication in this release.
A complete switch-over to TLS for this communication channel will follow on in a subsequent release.

### <a id='containers'></a>Containers Default to Running Unprivileged

All newly staged containers will run as unprivileged.

### <a id='diego'></a>Diego and the Routing API Use a Relational Datastore

Both Diego and the Routing API have switched over to using a relational database as their backing store.

### <a id='one-off'></a>Support for Running One-Off Tasks

In addition to managing long-running processes, the platform will now have first-class support for running one-off tasks.

### <a id='net-core'></a>.NET Core Buildpack

The .NET Core Buildpack is now included as a core buildpack for application developers.
This buildpack is for use with applications running .Net Core on Linux.

### <a id='actuators'></a>Support for Spring Boot Actuators in Apps Manager

Apps Manage now securely integrates the `/health`, `/info`, and `/logger` Spring Boot actuators.

If an app is configured with these actuators, users will see the following in Apps Manager:
* Info: git commit information will be available in the app page header, and on the app settings tab. Raw output of the `info` actuator is also available on the app settings tab.
* Health: the output of the `health` actuator for each instance will be displayed in the instances table on the summary tab of an app. The instance rows can be expanded to show the full details of the `health` endpoint for any instance.
* Logger: On the logs tab, the "Configure Logging" button will appear, allowing the user to temporarily configure log levels for the application's loggers without a push or restart.

For more information, see the documentation for [Spring Boot Actuators](../console/spring-boot-actuators.html) and [Using Actuators](../console/using-actuators.html).

### <a id='autoscaling'></a>New Autoscaling Features

The autoscaling service provides new scaling metrics for application developers.
In addition to CPU Utilization, the service now supports HTTP Throughput and HTTP Latency as metrics to decide application scaling events.
HTTP Throughput measures the number of incoming HTTP requests per second per application instance.
HTTP Latency measures application response latency at the 99th and 95th percentiles.
For all metrics, application developers can set upper and lower thresholds to decide whether the service should scale the application.
All metrics are computes as a 30 second rolling average.
With the new "Standard" plan, rules are evaluated every 5 seconds.
The autoscaling service now also allows for multiple metrics to be combined for a single application.
Finally, to make automation of the interactions with the autoscaling service much easier, the service now supports a REST-based API to manage your application scaling configuration.
