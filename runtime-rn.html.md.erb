## <a id='upgrade'></a>How to Upgrade

The procedure for upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime v1.10 is documented in the
[Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic.

When upgrading to v1.10, be aware of the following upgrade considerations:

   * You must upgrade to a version of Elastic Runtime v1.9.0 or higher in order to successfully upgrade to v1.10.
   * Before upgrading to PCF v1.10, remove any product tiles that are no longer supported in PCF.
     See [Review and Remove Unsupported Products](../../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#remove-products).<br><br/>
     Some partner service tiles may currently be incompatible with PCF v1.10. Pivotal is working with partners to
     ensure their tiles are being updated to work with the latest versions of PCF.<br/><br/>
     For information about which partner service releases are currently compatible with PCF v1.10, review the
     appropriate partners services release documentation at [http://docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io), or
     contact the partner organization that produces the tile.

## <a id='1.10.0'></a> New Features in Elastic Runtime v1.10.0

This section describes new features of the release.

### <a id='container-networking'></a>Container Networking

The Elastic Runtime now offers a Container Networking feature that puts applications onto their own overlay network.

For more information, see [Container Networking](../adminguide/container-networking.html).

### <a id='volume-services'></a>Volume Services

There is now general support for volume services inside of application containers.

### <a id='etcd-tls'></a>Secured etcd Cluster

This release removes the etcd Proxy VM, ensuring all communication to the etcd cluster happens over a secured connection.

### <a id='rate-limiting'></a>CF API Rate Limiting

The CF API can enforce rate limits for users and clients. The limits can be enabled on the "Advanced Features" page within the ERT.

Limits can be set for authenticated and unauthenticated clients and expire over a rolling hour-long window.

### <a id='cfdot'></a>`cfdot`

All Diego VMs now include an operator toolkit for interacting with your Diego components.

More details about `cfdot` can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cfdot).

### <a id='cc-clock'></a>Multi-node Cloud Controller Clock

The Cloud Controller Clock has been outfitted to allow multiple instances of the VM to run in parallel.

Operators can scale the instance count for the VM to fit their needs.
