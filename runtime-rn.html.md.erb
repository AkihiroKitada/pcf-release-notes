## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

The procedure for upgrading to Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.4 is documented in the [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic.

When upgrading to v2.4, be aware of the following upgrade considerations:

* If you previously used an earlier version of PAS, you must first upgrade to PAS v2.3 to successfully upgrade to PAS v2.4.

* You must enable route integity before upgrading to PAS v2.4. To enable route integrity, go to **Application Containers** in PAS and select **Router uses TLS to verify application identity**. This option does use approximately 32MB more memory per application.

* Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v2.4. Pivotal is working with partners to ensure their tiles are updated to work with the latest versions of PCF.<br/><br/> For information about which partner service releases are currently compatible with PCF v2.4, review the appropriate partners services release documentation at [https://docs.pivotal.io](https://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner organization that produces the tile.


## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in PAS v2.4

### <a id="credhub-v2"></a> Credhub v2

Credhub is now v2.x and is on by default...

### <a id="route-integrity"></a> Route integrity can no longer be disabled

By default, you the router will use TLS to verify application identity. If upgrading from PAS 2.3, this option must be turned on before upgrading.


## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

### <a id='autoscaling-did-not-scale'></a> Autoscaling smoke test failure

Autoscaling smoke tests fail with "test app did not scale up." This is fixed by log-cache 1.4.4, which we will bump to in the next release.

### <a id='tcp-port-config'></a> Configuring Multiple TCP Routing Ports

This section describes an issue and workaround related to configuring multiple TCP Routing Ports in the PAS tile UI. 

#### Issue

You cannot enter a comma-separated list of ports in the **TCP Routing Ports** field of the PAS tile. If you enter a comma-separated list, the Routing API does not start. The **TCP Routing Ports** field allows entries in the following formats:

* A single value, such as `1234`
* A range of values, such as `1234-5678`

#### Workaround

If you want to configure multiple ports, do the following:

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This procedure causes brief downtime for TCP apps listening on ports that you open after deploying PAS.</p>

1. Configure PAS with **Enable TCP Routing** selected.

1. Enter one port you want to use in the **TCP Routing Ports** field.

1. Deploy PAS.

1. Use the Routing API to add all desired TCP ports by following the instructions in the [Modify your TCP ports](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html#modify-ports) section of the _Enabling TCP Routing_ topic. When using the Routing API, you can include a comma separated list of ports.
