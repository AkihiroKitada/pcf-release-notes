## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

The procedure for upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Elastic Runtime v1.12 is
documented in the [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud
Foundry](../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic.

When upgrading to v1.12, be aware of the following upgrade considerations:

* You must upgrade first to a version of Elastic Runtime v1.11.x to
  successfully upgrade to v1.12.
* If your existing PCF v1.11.x installation includes both <a href="../windows/index.html">PCF Runtime 
 for Windows</a> and MySQL for PCF v1.x, you must upgrade to MySQL for PCF v1.10.3 or later 
 before you upgrade to PCF Elastic Runtime v1.12. For instructions on how to upgrade MySQL for 
 PCF, see the 
 <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/index.html">MySQL for PCF</a> documentation.
 
* Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v1.12. Pivotal is
  working with partners to ensure their tiles are being updated to work with the
  latest versions of PCF.<br/><br/> For information about which partner service
  releases are currently compatible with PCF v1.12, review the appropriate
  partners services release documentation at
  [https://docs.pivotal.io](https://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner
  organization that produces the tile.
