## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

The procedure for upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime v1.11 is documented in the
[Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic.

When upgrading to v1.11, be aware of the following upgrade considerations:

* You must upgrade first to a version of Elastic Runtime v1.10.x in order to
  successfully upgrade to v1.11.
* Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v1.11. Pivotal is
  working with partners to ensure their tiles are being updated to work with the
  latest versions of PCF.<br/><br/> For information about which partner service
  releases are currently compatible with PCF v1.11, review the appropriate
  partners services release documentation at
  [http://docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner
  organization that produces the tile.

## <a id='adv-features'></a> About Advanced Features

The Advanced Features section of the Elastic Runtime tile includes new
functionality that may have certain constraints.

Although these features are fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when
using them in production.

## <a id='1.11.0'></a> New Features in Elastic Runtime v1.11.0

This section describes new features of the release.

### <a id='apps-manager-508'></a> Apps Manager 508 Compliance

Apps Manager has improved its compliance with [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/)
of the Rehabilitation Act. Customers can now receive an approved Voluntary Product
Accessibility Template (VPAT) for Apps Manager.

### <a id='container-networking'></a> Container-to-Container Networking

The Container-to-Container Networking feature in Elastic Runtime is now
generally available. For more information, see the
[Container-to-Container Networking](../devguide/deploy-apps/cf-networking.html) topic.

### <a id='volume-services'></a> Volume Services

General support for volume services inside of application containers is now
generally available. Additionally, the Elastic Runtime ships with an NFS Volume
Service Broker.

For more information, see
[Using an External File System (Volume Services)](../devguide/services/using-vol-services.html)
and [Enabling NFS Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html).

### <a id='disk-quotas'></a> Increased Application Maximum Disk Quotas

For applications that require large amounts of disk, the maximum disk quota has been raised
to 20GB. This will allow application developers to specify a disk size up to 20GB for their
applications.

Operators should take note that applications with large disk settings can be difficult for
Diego to find a placement for. If there is not enough disk on any of the Diego Cells,
developers will see an "insufficient resources" error message. Ensuring your Diego Cells
provide enough disk to accomodate these much larger application instances will be an
important part of your resource planning.

### <a id='ha-defaults'></a> Highly-Available Default Configuration

The Resource Configuration defaults have been changed to streamline the path to a
production-ready deployment. The default instance count for each VM type in the
deployment has been set to ensure an operator can deploy a highly-available Cloud
Foundry out of the box.

This change will result in larger resource requirements for a default Elastic Runtime
deployment. Operators should take this into account when deploying environments on
constrained resources.

### <a id='sha2-checksums'></a> Component BOSH releases are SHA2-checksummed

BOSH now supports releases that include a SHA2-checksum of their contents. All the
releases included in the Elastic Runtime have been checksummed with SHA2 for improved
data integrity in the face of hash collisions.

### <a id='bbr'></a> BOSH Backup and Restore

The Elastic Runtime now includes support for the new BOSH Backup and Restore tool (`bbr`).
Using `bbr` allow an operator to take a snapshot of their internal blobstore and databases.

### <a id='priv-docker-reg'></a> Private Docker Registries

Application developers can now push Docker-based applications with images that are hosted
on a private registry.

### <a id='uaa-sql-server'></a> UAA supports SQL Server database

Operators can now independently configure their UAA service to store its data in an external
SQL Server database.

### <a id='locket'></a> Improved Distributed Lock Management

In older versions of the Elastic Runtime, components that needed to maintain a distributed
lock could leverage Consul to handle the locking mechanism. In 1.11, that locking mechanism
has been replaced with a new service called `locket`. By switching to `locket`, the Elastic
Runtime will be moving onto a more stable footing for its distributed locking needs.

### <a id='internal-uaa-expire'></a> UAA User Passwords Never Expire

As of v1.11, Elastic Runtime no longer provides the **Number of Months Before
Password Expires** field in the **Authentication and Enterprise SSO** section.
Instead, it sets the value to zero, which means that UAA user passwords for
deployments using internal UAA never expire.

If you have set a non-zero password expiry, Elastic Runtime will set it to zero when you upgrade from v1.10 to v1.11.

### <a id='syslog'></a> Scalable Syslog

Loggregator now uses the [Scalable Syslog](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/scalable-syslog-release) BOSH release to support streaming app logs to syslog-compatible aggregation or analytics services. This new delivery method has the following benefits: 

* Decouples syslog drains from the Firehose
* Prevents log loss in the Firehose that previously resulted from syslog drains competing for the resources used to deliver logs  
* Provides high message reliability for syslog drains
* Maintains the UX of binding an app to a syslog drain service through Cloud Foundry user-provided services (CUPS)

For more information about Scalabe Syslog in PCF, see [Overview of the Loggregator System](../loggregator/architecture.html).

## <a id='knownissues'></a> Known Issues

This section lists known issues for PCF Elastic Runtime.

###<a id='metrics'></a>Loggregator Metrics

Reverse Log Proxy (RLP) and Traffic Controller emit metrics tagged with a hard-coded deployment name. Because the components do not allow the deployment name to be configured, Metron cannot properly tag the metrics. This affects the following metrics:

* `loggregator.rlp.ingress`
* `loggregator.rlp.dropped`
* `loggregator.rlp.egress`
* `loggregator.trafficcontroller.ingress`

###<a id='mount-location'></a>Mount Location Bug

If you have the `VOLUME ["/some/data/dir"]` directive in your image, ensure your `"mount"` section in your bind JSON matches what is in the Dockerfile, such as `"mount":"/some/data/dir"`. 

See [this example Dockerfile](https://github.com/azwickey-pivotal/volume-demo/blob/master/Dockerfile#L5) on GitHub for reference.

This only works if the path in question is in an already existing root level folder.  In other words, `"/var/some/random/path"` should work, but `"/some/random/path"` will cause your app to crash at startup. This limitation is due to an aufs bug.
