### Routing

- TCP Routing enables developers to run applications on PCF that support non-HTTP TCP protocols. Please see "this topic" for more information.
   - To support this, Routing components fetch tokens from UAA by calling that component directly over TLS. The cert hosted by UAA is generated by Operations Manager.
- Some processes on the Gorouter job no longer run as root.
- Route services whose domain names are resolved using EDNS0 are now supported.


### Authentication and Authorization

- Apps Manager now supports inviting external users from LDAP & SAML user stores. Please refer to the [Link Topic](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/1-8/opsguide/external-user-management.html) for more details. 

- PCF Admin role can now be derived from SAML group memberships. Please refer to the [Link Topic] for more details.

- Basic User Attributes including First Name, Last Name and Email can now be derived from the the SAML or LDAP enabled external user store. Please refer to [Link Topic] for more details.

- The Login prompts displayed on the Login Page and in the CF CLI can now be configured. Please refer to [Link Topic] for more details.

- New API Docs for UAA are now available at [http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/).

### Docker Proxy Server

This feature allows you to put a proxy server between your PCF deployment and Docker Hub for access to image files.

Please see "this topic" for more information.

### Unpriviledged App Containers

You can now switch off priviledged containers for your applications.

Please see [this topic - needs link updated when 1.8 docs published](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/1-8/concepts/container-security.html) for more information.

### AWS SSE-S3

Blobstores for Cloud Controller can now be encrypted at rest using SSE-S3. Existing blobs will not be encrypted.

Please see [this topic - needs link updated when 1.8 docs published](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/1-8/customizing/pcf-aws-manual-er-config.html#file-store-config) for more information.

### NFS Migration to WebDav

The internal file store provisioned by Cloud Foundry for Cloud Controller files has been switched from an NFS server to the WebDav protocol. There will be no actual data migration as part of this switch, it will simply change the protocol on this file server. When you upgrade to Elastic Runtime 1.8.0 or greater, you will automatically be switched over.

### Configurable SSH Proxy for Diego Containers

As of 1.8.0, you can also now specify the static IP addresses for the Diego Brain job, which allows you to configure a load balancer to forward SSH traffic over port 2222 to these proxies, which then grant you access to application containers.

### Console DB Disappears

With the introduction of a new Apps Manager app written in Javascript, there is no longer a need for a backend to this app. Therefore, the Apps Manager's database (console is the DB name) will be dropped from the Elastic Runtime tile. If your backend is MySQL for console-db, you can drop this database from the MySQL server yourself if you wish. You also no longer need to backup and restore this database.

## Collector deprecation

As of 1.8.0, the JMX Bridge (previously known as Ops Metrics) no longer requires an log streaming input from the Collector job on Elastic Runtime, therefore you may scale down this job to zero instances once you have the ? JMX bridge version installed.

### API Environment Variable Visibility

Similar to `space_developer_env_var_visibility`, the new feature flag `env_var_visibility` can be disabled to deny access to `/v2/apps/:guid/env` for all users, including administrators.
