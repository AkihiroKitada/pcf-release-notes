### Routing

- TCP Routing enables developers to run apps on PCF that support non-HTTP TCP protocols. See the [HTTP vs TCP Routes](../../devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#http-vs-tcp-routes) topic for more information.
   - To support this, routing components fetch tokens from UAA by calling that component directly over TLS. The cert hosted by UAA is generated by Operations Manager.
- Some processes on the Gorouter job no longer run as root.
- Route services whose domain names are resolved using EDNS0 are now supported.


### Authentication and Authorization

- Apps Manager now supports inviting external users from LDAP & SAML user stores. See the [Adding Existing SAML or LDAP Users to a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Deployment](../../opsguide/external-user-management.html) topic for more information. 

- PCF Admin role can now be derived from SAML group memberships. See the [Grant Admin Permissions to an External Group (SAML or LDAP)](../../adminguide/uaa-user-management.html#external-group) topic for more information.

- Basic User Attributes including Email, First Name, and Last Name can now be derived from the the SAML or LDAP enabled external user store. See the [Retrieve User Email Addresses](../../adminguide/uaa-user-management.html#retrieving-email-addresses) topic for more information.

- The Login prompts displayed on the Login Page and in the CF CLI can now be configured. See the [Configuring Authentication and Enterprise SSO for Elastic Runtime](../../opsguide/auth-sso.html) topic for more information.

- New API Docs for UAA are now available at [http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/).

### Docker Proxy Server

This feature allows you to put a proxy server between your PCF deployment and Docker Hub for access to image files.

See the [Set Proxies for Docker Trusted Registries](../../opsguide/docker-registry.html#proxy) topic for more information.

### Pivotal Account User Management Tool

Pivotal Account is a user management tool that allows users to create and manage their accounts. With Pivotal Account users can access apps assigned to their accounts as well as manage their apps. See the [Enabling Pivotal Account](../../opsguide/pivotal-account.html) topic for more information. 

### Unprivileged App Containers

You can now switch off privileged containers for your apps.

See the [Understanding Container Security](../../concepts/container-security.html) topic for more information.

### AWS SSE-S3

External file storage existing as blobstores for Cloud Controller can now be encrypted at rest using SSE-S3 on any IAAS supported by PCF. Existing blobs are not encrypted.

For example, see the [Configure File Storage](../../customizing/config-er-vmware.html#filestore-config) topic for more information on configuring SSE-S3 for VSphere and vCloud Air.

### NFS Migration to WebDAV

The internal file storage provisioned by Cloud Foundry for Cloud Controller files has been switched from an NFS server to the WebDAV protocol. There is no actual data migration as part of this switch. The protocol changes on the file server. When you upgrade to Elastic Runtime v1.8.0 or later, you are automatically switched over.

See this [Knowledge Base article](https://discuss.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217982188-How-to-use-Elastic-Runtime-blob-storage-data-) for more information about file storage. 

### Configurable SSH Proxy for Diego Containers

As of PCF v1.8.0, you can specify static IP addresses for the Diego Brain job, which allows you to configure a load balancer to forward SSH traffic over port 2222 to these SSH proxy IPs. Configuring a load balancer for Diego Brain IP addresses allows SSH access to app containers.

For example, see the [Configure Networking](../../customizing/cloudform-er-config.html#networking) topic for more information.

### Console Database Removed

With the introduction of a new Apps Manager app written in Javascript, there is no longer a need for a backend to this app. Therefore, the Apps Manager database (`console`) is dropped from the Elastic Runtime tile. However, if you selected MySQL as the backend database for `console` during initial Elastic Runtime deployment, you can drop this database from the MySQL server yourself. If you do not drop the database, you no longer need to backup and restore this database.

## Collector Deprecation

As of PCF v1.8.0, the JMX Bridge (previously known as Ops Metrics) no longer requires a log streaming input from the Collector job on Elastic Runtime. Therefore, you can scale this job down to zero instances after you have installed JMX Bridge v ?. <-- Amber

### API Environment Variable Visibility

Similar to `space_developer_env_var_visibility`, the new feature flag `env_var_visibility` can be disabled to deny access to `/v2/apps/:guid/env` for all users, including administrators. 

See the [Feature Flags](../../adminguide/listing-feature-flags.html#flags) topic for more information.

### Service Broker Improvements

Service brokers can respond with an `operation` string in the body of responses for asynchronous operations. This string will be returned to the broker when the Cloud Controller polls for the state of asynchronous operations (see below). For more information, see the response body for [Provisioning](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/services/api-v2.9.html#provisioning), [Deprovisioning](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/services/api-v2.9.html#deprovisioning), and [Updating](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/services/api-v2.9.html#updating_service_instance).

Service brokers will now receive `service_id`, `plan_id`, and `operation` when polled for last operation state by the Cloud Controller. These extra query parameters can be used by brokers to help determine the state of the last operation. See [Polling Last Operation](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/services/api-v2.9.html#polling) for more information.
