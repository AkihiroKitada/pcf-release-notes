### Diego completely replaces DEAs

Before you upgrade to Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7, you must migrate all apps that are currently running on DEA architecture to run on Diego architecture. Pivotal does not support DEA architecture in Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7. You may need to scale up your VMs before migrating applications. More information can be found [here](../../customizing/apps-enable-diego.html).

If you have any issues migrating your applications to Diego, please contact Support.

### Elastic Runtime Tile UI Changes

The tile has been re-designed in layout to improve the configuration workflow for operators. Several configuration fields have been moved to different sections of the tile. Also, more advanced logic has been implemented for some sections to make configuring complicated networking use cases easier for operators.

### Compiled Releases

Installs and upgrades of Elastic Runtime are now much faster than before, as the installation now makes use of compiled binaries instead of source code.

### Automated Backups

Operators using Pivotal Elastic Runtime can enable automatic backup on S3-compatible blobstores. This feature can be enabled for ERT running AWS, OpenStack, or vSphere.

Please see [this topic](../../customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf.html#backup-mysql) for more information.

### Docker Private Registries

Please see [this topic](../../opsguide/docker-registry.html) for information on Docker Trusted and Private registries.

### Unused Docker Image Cleanup

In the Application Containers configuration section of Elastic Runtime, you can configure how aggressively unused Docker Image files are removed from disk on Diego Cell VMs. The advantage to cleaning up less frequently is that subsequent push/scale events for Docker Images that have previously been run on the platform may be faster, since the image does not need to be downloaded from the Docker registry again. The "Threshold of Disk-Used (MB)" value refers to the total size of all Docker Images (whether in use or not) on an individual Cell VM.

### Route Services
Route Services are a new kind of Marketplace Service that developers can use to apply various transformations to application requests by binding an application’s route to a service instance. Through integrations with service brokers and optionally with the Cloud Foundry routing tier, providers can offer these services to developers with a familiar automated, self-service, and on-demand user experience.

Please see [this topic](../../services/route-services.html) for more information.

### Space Scoped Private Brokers
Space scoped private brokers allow a space developer to create and manage a service broker and scope it to a single space in order to allow faster iteration on service brokers without requiring full admin privileges.

Please see the [managing service brokers](../../services/managing-service-brokers.html) topic for more information.
This feature can be managed with the `space_scoped_private_broker_creation` cloud controller feature flag.

### Experimental Feature: Disk and Memory Overcommit Settings

If your apps do not use the full allocation of disk space and memory set in the <strong>Resource Config</strong> tab, you may want use this feature. These fields control the amount to overcommit disk and memory resources to assign more memory and disk space to each Diego Cell VM.

Please see [this topic](../../customizing/cloudform-er-config.html#experimental-features) for more information.

### Experimental Feature: Diego Tasks

Although you can use the V3 Tasks API to run asynchronous tasks, Pivotal reserves
the right to change this API or truncate the data about past task runs. For more
information about running one-off tasks in Cloud Foundry, see the
[Cloud Foundry V3 API Docs](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/release-candidate/index.html#tasks).

### AWS Cloudformation Script Update

You can now specify whether you would like to enable HTTP traffic to port 80 of your ELB if you are setting up an environment in AWS to deploy PCF.

### App Manager White Labeling
Pivotal Cloud Foundry® operators can now visually brand Apps Manager by changing certain text, colors, and images of the interface. Developers will see the customized interface when logging in, creating an account, resetting a password, or using Apps Manager.

Please see [this topic](../../opsguide/custom-branding.html) for more information.

##  Identity (aka UAA Server)

### UAA PW Policy Config in ERT

Operators can now specify some password policies in the UAA section of Elastic Runtime, including password length, specific character type requirements, expiration, and maximum password attempts allowed.

Please see [this topic](../../opsguide/pw-policy.html) for more information.

### UAA SAML features
Please see [this topic](../../opsguide/auth-sso.html) for more information.

### UAA Token Lifetime Settings
Please see [this topic](../../customizing/cloudform-er-config.html#er-auth-config) for more information.
