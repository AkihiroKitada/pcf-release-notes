title: Pivotal Elastic Runtime v1.8 Known Issues
owner: Release Engineering
---

## New Issues

* The Single Sign-On service tile operates in lockstep with Pivotal Elastic Runtime. If you are a customer upgrading from PCF 1.7 to PCF 1.8 and you are using SSO v1.1.X, you must upgrade to the SSO v1.2.0 service tile when you upgrade the Elastic Runtime Tile to 1.8. 

* If you choose to enable TCP routing, the reservable port range cannot be modified after deployment. This will be made possible in the next patch release.

* If you choose to enable TCP routing, you must also add the TCP routing domain via the cf CLI after deploying Elastic Runtime. The TCP routing domain is not configurable in the Elastic Runtime tile.

## Existing Issues

* Consul server cluster can fail to recover from quorum loss.

* etcd and Consul clusters do not self-heal in cases where they happen to enter split-brain.

* Disaster recovery for etcd or Consul clusters still requires manual intervention.

* The CLI command for viewing application files, `cf files`, does not work with apps on Diego.

* .NET support on Windows cells does not support the same level of security and isolation as seen on Linux cells. At this time, it is only recommended for running "trusted" apps.

* At this time, the container accounts on Windows cells must have permissions to log on locally, which may not be the default.

* Application file names on Windows cells are limited to maximum length of 100 characters. As a workaround, make sure that all filenames in an application directory are shorter than 100 characters before pushing.
