title: Pivotal Elastic RuntimeFoundry v1.8 Known Issues
owner: Release Engineering
---

## New Issues

* The Single Sign-On service tile operates in lockstep with Pivotal Elastic Runtime. If you are a customer upgrading from PCF 1.7 to PCF 1.8 and you are using SSO v?, you must upgrade to the SSO v? service tile when you upgrade the Elastic Runtime Tile to 1.8.

* The Push Notifications service tile operates in lockstep with Pivotal Elastic Runtime. If you are a customer upgrading from PCF 1.6 to PCF 1.7 and you are using Push Notifications v1.4.4 or earlier versions, you must upgrade to the Push Notifications v1.4.5 tile when you upgrade the Elastic Runtime Tile to 1.7. <- not sure about this, ask Matthew Smith

* Apps Manager's "Tools" page links to the incorrect version of the cf CLI. To get the latest version, download it directly from [the CLI releases page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases). <- ask Mike G

* If you choose to enable TCP Routing, the reservable port range cannot be modified after deployment. This will be made possible in the next patch release.

* If you choose to enable TCP Routing, you will also have to add the TCP routing domain post-deployment of Elastic Runtime via the CF CLI, it is not configurable in the Elastic Runtime tile itself. <- ask Abby/Shannon

## Existing Issues

* Consul server cluster can fail to recover from quorum loss.

* etcd and Consul clusters do not self-heal in cases where they happen to enter split-brain.

* Disaster recovery for etcd or Consul clusters still requires manual intervention.

(ask Eric M. about the following 3 items)
* Diego Cells may sometimes experience slow performance for various actions like staging new applications. If you experience slow performance, you can SSH into the Ops Manager VM and `bosh-recreate` the affected Diego Cell VM.

* Docker library images require you to specify "library/" in front of the docker image name. E.g "cf p jetty -o library/jetty"

* The CLI command for viewing application files, `cf files`, does not work with applications on Diego.

* .NET support on Windows cells does not support the same level of security and isolation as seen on Linux cells. At this time, it is only recommended for running "trusted" apps.

* At this time, the container accounts on Windows cells must have permissions to log on locally, which may not be the default.

* Application file names on Windows cells are limited to maximum length of 100 characters. As a workaround, make sure that all filenames in an application directory are shorter than 100 characters before pushing.
