This topic describes the breaking changes you need to be aware of when upgrading to
Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.4. For more information about important preparation steps

## <a id='pas'></a> Pivotal Application Service (PAS)

See the following PAS breaking changes:

None currently.




## <a id='opsman'></a> PCF Ops Manager

See the following PCF Ops Manager breaking changes:

### <a id="excluded-recursors"></a> Excluded Recursors API Field Has Moved

The `excluded_recursors` field is now grouped under `dns_configuration` instead of `director_configuration` when you use the `GET /api/v0/staged/director/properties` API endpoint. 

This API endpoint fetches the BOSH Director, IaaS, and security properties. If you have scripts that rely on the `GET` output of this endpoint, they may break because of this moved field.

For more information about the API endpoint, see [Staged BOSH
Director](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#staged-bosh-director) in the
Ops Manager API documentation.

### <a id="relp"></a> Ops Manager Removes Support for RELP

Reliable Event Logging Protocols (RELPs) are not in common use by PCF customers. Ops Manager v2.4 removes RELP support to refine engineering focus and streamline future development. 

Pivotal recommends that RELP users switch to TCP.

## <a id='ist'></a> PCF Isolation Segment
