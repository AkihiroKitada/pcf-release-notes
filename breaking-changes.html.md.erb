title: PCF v2.2 Breaking Changes
owner: Release Engineering
---

This topic describes the breaking changes you need to be aware of when upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.2. For more information about important preparation steps you must follow before beginning an upgrade, see [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/2-1/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).


## <a id='pas'></a> Pivotal Application Service (PAS)

### <a id="timestamp"></a> Log Aggregation Systems May Parse Diego Timestamps Incorrectly

For new installations of PAS v2.2,
Diego timestamps in logs are now in RFC 3339 format.
The Unix epoch format is set by default for upgrades to PAS v2.2.

You can enable RFC 3339 format in your PAS tile configuration. Before enabling RFC 3339 format for Diego logs, ensure that your log aggregation system anticipates the timestamp format change.

If you experience issues, you can disable RFC 3339 format in the PAS tile.
For more information about this PCF v2.2 feature, see [PCF v2.2 Feature Highlights](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/installing/highlights.html#timestamp) and [New Format for Diego Timestamps](runtime-rn.html#timestamp) in _Pivotal Application Service v2.2 Release Notes_.

### <a id="ssh-client"></a> SSH Proxy May Restrict Client Access

The SSH proxy now accepts a narrower range of ciphers, MACs, and key exchanges. This feature may have complications if you use a SSH client other than <code>cf ssh</code> to connect. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html#other-ssh-access">Application SSH Access without cf CLI</a>.

### <a id="db-tls-downtime"></a> Temporary Downtime when Migrating Internal System Databases 

Upgrading existing internal system databases to the new option of **Internal Databases - MySQL - Percona XtraDB Cluster** causes temporary downtime of PAS system functions. It does not interrupt apps hosted by PAS. For more information, see [MySQL Migration Downtime](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/scaling-down-mysql.html#mysql-downtime).

### <a id="autoscaler-log-cache"></a> App Autoscaler Fails When Loggregator's Log Cache Is Disabled

App Autoscaler relies on API endpoints in Loggregator's Log Cache component. If you disable Log Cache, App Autoscaler will fail. For more information about Log Cache, see [Loggregator Introduces Log Cache](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#log-cache).

## <a id='opsman'></a> Ops Manager

### <a id="bosh-dns"></a> Redeploy All Products After Upgrading to Ops Manager v2.2

When upgrading to PCF v2.2, redeploy all product tiles by clicking **Apply Changes** in the Ops Manager installation dashboard. A universal redeploy ensures that the updated BOSH DNS release applies consistently to all products. 

Do not use the **Review Pending Changes** button to deploy product tiles individually during the upgrade to PCF v2.2. Instead, redeploy everything and selectively deploy individual product tiles only after you have successfully upgraded to PCF v2.2. 

For more information about selective deployment, see [(Beta) Selectively Deploy Ops Manager Tiles](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#selective-deploy).

### <a id="om-syslog"></a> Ops Manager Logs Have Changed Locations

Ops Manager centralized its logs so that you can now configure a syslog server in the Ops Manager **Settings**. Because of this feature change for Ops Manager v2.2, you cannot run scripts to fetch Ops Manager logs at their previous locations. Instead, Pivotal now recommends you configure syslog.

For more information about the syslog feature, see [Configure an Ops Manager Syslog Server](opsmanager-rn.html#om-syslog) in the _PCF Ops Manager Release v2.2 Release Notes_.


## <a id='ist'></a> PCF Isolation Segment

### <a id="ist-timestamp"></a> Log Aggregation Systems May Parse Diego Timestamps Incorrectly

See [New Format for Diego Timestamps](segment-rn.html#timestamp) in _PCF Isolation Segment v2.2 Release Notes_ and breaking changes for [Pivotal Application Service (PAS)](#timestamp) for more information.
