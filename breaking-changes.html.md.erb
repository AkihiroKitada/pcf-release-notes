title: PCF v2.2 Breaking Changes
owner: Release Engineering
---

This topic describes the breaking changes you need to be aware of when upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.2. For more information about important preparation steps you must follow before beginning an upgrade, see [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/2-2/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).


## <a id='pas'></a> Pivotal Application Service (PAS)

### <a id="timestamp"></a> Log Aggregation Systems May Parse Diego Timestamps Incorrectly

The timestamps in the Diego component logs are now in a format compatible with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339">RFC 3339</a>.

This timestamp format is enabled by default for new PAS v2.2 deployments. Upgrades from earlier PAS versions retain the previous component log format with Unix epoch timestamps.

You can enable the new timestamp format in your PAS tile configuration. Before enabling the new timestamp format for Diego logs, ensure that your log aggregation system anticipates the timestamp format change.

If you experience issues, you can disable RFC 3339 format in the PAS tile.
For more information about this PCF v2.2 feature, see [PCF v2.2 Feature Highlights](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/installing/highlights.html#timestamp) and [New Format for Timestamps in Diego Component Logs](runtime-rn.html#timestamp) in _Pivotal Application Service v2.2 Release Notes_.

### <a id="ssh-client"></a> SSH Proxy May Restrict Client Access

The SSH proxy now accepts a narrower range of ciphers, MACs, and key exchanges. This feature may have complications if you use a SSH client other than <code>cf ssh</code> to connect. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html#other-ssh-access">Application SSH Access without cf CLI</a>.

### <a id="db-tls-downtime"></a> Temporary Downtime when Migrating Internal System Databases 

If you use internal system databases, migrating the databases to the new option of **Internal Databases - MySQL - Percona XtraDB Cluster** causes temporary downtime of PAS system functions. Migrating the database does not interrupt apps running on PAS, but does temporarily prevent you from pushing new ones. For more information, see [Migrate to Internal Percona MySQL](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/opsguide/scaling-down-mysql.html#migrate).

PAS v2.2 deprecates the MariaDB Galera internal database option, and Pivotal plans to remove MariaDB Galera as a database option in PAS v2.3. To continue using internal system databases in future versions of PAS, you need to migrate them to Percona while you are running PAS v2.2, or else when you upgrade to PAS v2.3.

This change has no effect if you have **External Databases** selected in the PAS tile **Databases** pane.

### <a id="autoscaler-log-cache"></a> App Autoscaler Fails When Loggregator's Log Cache Is Disabled

App Autoscaler relies on API endpoints in Loggregator's Log Cache component. If you disable Log Cache, App Autoscaler will fail. For more information about Log Cache, see [Loggregator Introduces Log Cache](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#log-cache).

## <a id='opsman'></a> Ops Manager

### <a id="bosh-dns"></a> Redeploy All Products After Upgrading to Ops Manager v2.2

When upgrading to PCF v2.2, redeploy all product tiles by clicking **Apply Changes** in the Ops Manager installation dashboard. A universal redeploy ensures that the updated BOSH DNS release applies consistently to all products. 

Do not use the **Review Pending Changes** button to deploy product tiles individually during the upgrade to PCF v2.2. Instead, redeploy everything and selectively deploy individual product tiles only after you have successfully upgraded to PCF v2.2. 

For more information about selective deployment, see [(Beta) Selectively Deploy Ops Manager Tiles](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#selective-deploy).

### <a id="om-syslog"></a> Ops Manager Logs Have Changed Locations

Ops Manager centralized its logs so that you can now configure a syslog server in the Ops Manager **Settings**. Because of this feature change for Ops Manager v2.2, you cannot run scripts to fetch Ops Manager logs at their previous locations. Instead, Pivotal now recommends you configure syslog.

For more information about the syslog feature, see [Configure an Ops Manager Syslog Server](opsmanager-rn.html#om-syslog) in the _PCF Ops Manager Release v2.2 Release Notes_.

## <a id='ist'></a> PCF Isolation Segment

### <a id="ist-timestamp"></a> Log Aggregation Systems May Parse Diego Timestamps Incorrectly

See [New Format for Timestamps in Diego Component Logs](segment-rn.html#timestamp) in _PCF Isolation Segment v2.2 Release Notes_ and breaking changes for [Pivotal Application Service (PAS)](#timestamp) for more information.
