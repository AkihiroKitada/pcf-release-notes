This topic describes the breaking changes you need to be aware of when upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.1. For more information about important preparation steps you must follow before beginning an upgrade, see [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/2-1/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

## <a id='pas'></a> Pivotal Application Service (PAS)

### <a id='automated-backup'></a> Removal of Automated Backup Configuration for Internal MySQL

Starting in PCF 2.1, the PAS tile no longer includes the **Automated Backups Configuration** field. This option has been removed because it is not possible to restore the internal MySQL database from a full backup without degrading the Galera MySQL cluster. 

To back up and restore the internal MySQL database, you must use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR). See [Backing Up and Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/backup-restore/index.html) for information on using BBR. 

BBR provides the following advantages over the **Automated Backup Configuration**: 

* BBR locks the necessary APIs as part of the backup procedure. This release-level backup ensures correctness. See [PAS Component Behavior During Backup](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/backup-restore/component-backups.html). 
* BBR backs up the MySQL cluster and the blobstore together so that they are consistent.  
* BBR eliminates the need to manually remove the silk database table after restore. 

### <a id='pasw-injector'></a> PAS for Windows Requires Injector Step

Unlike other tiles, the PAS for Windows tile requires an additional step between downloading the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows) and uploading it to Ops Manager.

After you download the product file, you need to download and run the **PAS for Windows File System Injector** tool on the file locally, to add the Windows Server container base image. See [Installing and Configuring PAS for Windows](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/windows/installing.html#install) for details. You can download the injector tool from the PAS for Windows page on Pivotal Network.

If you try to upload the PAS for Windows product file without having run the injector tool, Ops Manager may show the following error:
`is invalid: has an invalid release 'windows2016fs' specified for job type 'Windows Diego Cell'`
