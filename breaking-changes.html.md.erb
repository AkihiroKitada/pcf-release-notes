This topic describes the breaking changes you need to be aware of when upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.3. For more information about important preparation steps you must follow before beginning an upgrade, see [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/2-3/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

### <a id="readonly-volume-mounts"></a> Read-only Volume Mounts

We back-ported a fix from NFS 1.3.1 to NFS 1.2.1 for an incompatibility between our NFS Volume release and Diego's container runtime, garden. But, because the fix was in the NFS Service Broker, and service bindings created by old versions of this broker won't get migrated during upgrade, existing NFS service bindings that specify read-only mounts will still exhibit the incompatibility.

As a result, customers upgrading from versions containing nfs-volume-release < 1.2.1 that have NFS services bound read-only to their applications will see that their applications crash after upgrade.

To fix this condition, customers should unbind the service, rebind it, and then restage the application.

Alternately, customers wishing to avoid application down time can temporarily re-bind their applications as read/write before upgrading, and then swtich to read-only afterwards.
